Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday\\'s Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.',\n",

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the \\'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\\'t make sense.\"\\n \\n That\\'s what the book says.  We don\\'t insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone\\'s entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

Depends on WHY it misfired....\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....\\n\\n\\nAssuming the cylinder WILL rotate....\\n\\n\\nNever hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you\\'ve got one of those\\n\\'new fangled\\' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it\\'s unnecessarily\\nredundant.  I\\'d rather have the extra round.\\n\\n\\nQuite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around\\nthan magazines though.\\n\\n\\nTrue, but this is a training function.\\n\\n\\nCocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions\\nare the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt\\'s for\\nexample are quite safe to carry this way.\\n\\n\\nAgreed.\\n\\nNow that I\\'ve shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It\\nis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn\\'t cost you much.  On\\nthe other hand, I\\'ve had all sorts of interesting things happen over the\\nyears.  For example, I\\'ve had FACTORY ammunition that has had high\\nprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds\\nto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.\\nAn auto?  Jack the slide and continue.\\n\\nI\\'ve had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from\\nturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen\\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\\n\\nMost revolvers are more \\'fragile\\' then semi auto\\'s.  There are all sorts\\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a\\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many\\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto\\ntake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely\\nto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you\\'re out of the fight.\\nThe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\\ninto that category.\\n\\nVincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing\\nview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob\\'s \"The Semi\\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"\\n\\nIn general, I\\'d agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\\n\\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\\nisn\\'t going to train them, they aren\\'t going to take the time on their\\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don\\'t bother.\\n\\nFor myself, I\\'d hate to be limited to one or the other.  I\\'d rather pick\\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I\\'m wearing that day\\nand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!\\n\\nThat said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of\\nbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a\\nRuger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok\\ntoo!)\\n\\nIf this post had gone the other way, I\\'d be arguing for revolvers. :-)',\n",
       " \" \\n\\n\\n\\nTed, you're missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a\\nprevious response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was\\nbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on\\na constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,\\non the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.\\n If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a\\ndifferent story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to\\nhire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is\\nan admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets\\ngame at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from\\nbaseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,\\nthat's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start\\nsuspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time\\nunder whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining\\nto play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the\\ndifferences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I\\nwould think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.\\n\\n\\n                                    -Sean\\n\\n\",\n",

Cassini is a joint\\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings.

In 1941, \\nwhile the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration \\ncamps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian \\nbattalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had \\ngrown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the\\nformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the\\nshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the \\ncold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.\\nAn Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party \\nleaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by \\nthis, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \\nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \\nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler\\'s policy of \\nextermination of the Jews.\\n\\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\"\\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\\nexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.\\n\\nFurthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted\\na respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros\\nArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided\\nto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province\\nof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia\\nclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia\\n(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it\\nhad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set\\nabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who\\ncould be expected to oppose their plans. \\n\\nOn April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian\\nand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British\\nplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even \\nthough the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over\\n60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the \\nBritish could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of\\nthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier\\nin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction\\nof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of\\nKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded\\nby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left \\nthe scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few \\nEuropeans were present to observe the genocide.

       " '\\nYes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws.\\nHowever, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all\\nfive schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against\\nmuslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do\\nnot know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and\\nopen hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know\\nthat\\nhistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone\\nby the death penalty.\\n\\nMy understanding is that Khomeini\\'s ruling was not based on the\\nlaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\\nprecedent in the Qur\\'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\\n\\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \"fasad\". This\\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\\n\\n\\nI would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was\\nlevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication\\nof the book. However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\\nlevelled at people, not books.\\n\\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \\nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\\n\\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.',\n",

Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services\\nCommittee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list\\nignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior\\nservice personnel.\\n   ROA\\'s executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),\\nsuggested \"concern that the only plausible alternative is that they\\nare intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve\\ncomponents from maintaining even today\\'s relatively low level of\\nparticipation in their parent service\\'s Total Force of the future.\"\\n   He asked the commission \"to remove from consideration all\\nlocations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to\\nwarrant approval of the requested action.\"\\n   \"Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve\\ninstallations on this list are large enough to have a significant\\nimpact on the community, if closed,\" wrote Hultman.  \"The major\\nissue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large\\npercentage of the existing locations.\"\\n   Hultman reminded the commission, \"The fact that the vast\\nmajority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come\\nclose to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this\\nprocess certainly supports the thesis\" that these actions are\\nsimply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and\\nMarine Corps Reserve.\\n   ROA also noted \"that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of\\nNaval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480\\nNaval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are\\napproved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.\"\\n   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging\\nfrom South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval\\nReserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to\\nMissoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps Reserve\\nCenters include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind.,\\nBillings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.\\n   A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at El\\nToro, Calif., plus six others.\\n -30-',\n",

Automatic setups are fine for simple,\\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\\nin \"equivalent time\" or in \"real time\" sampling mode (equivalent time\\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope\\'s actual sampling\\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\\n\\nIs the HP scope you\\'re using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\\n\\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\\nof the scope.

A \\nshort-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda \\nand anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious \\nfor the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their \\nneighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely \\nwithin Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to \\nx-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is \\nthe historic homeland and the \\'cradle\\' of the artistic and literary \\nheritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous, \\neven lunatic. \\n\\nAnd we still demand:\\n\\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \\ndictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\\nKurdish people;\\n\\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their\\nheinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide \\nand Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian \\npolitical pressure.\\n\\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \\ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. \\n\\nNow what would you do? \\n\\nSource: \\'The Sunday Times,\\' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by \\n        Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)\\n\\n    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.\\n\\n    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former\\nSoviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of\\nhundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.\\n    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more\\nthan 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an\\nattack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and\\nfeared dead.\\n    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending\\nthe women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified\\nrefugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:\" That\\'s when\\nthe real  slaughter began,\" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to\\nsurvive. \"The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and\\nstarted carving up people with their bayonets and knives.\"\\n    \" They were shooting, shooting, shooting\", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who\\narrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through\\nArmenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed\\nin front of her. Her daughter was still missing.\\n    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.\\n\\n    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,\\nwere still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their\\nwounds or the cold.\\n    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in\\nAgdam\\'s morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the\\nseven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were\\nwomen, one shot through the chest at point blank range.\\n    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they\\nhad 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep\\nstab wounds.\\n    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city\\nwhich  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and\\nkilling one person.\\n\\nSerdar Argic',\n",

       " '\\n   Watch out.  Often when some scumbag steals the cover, that means\\n   that they were or are looking to steal the bike.  In my case, I\\n   had a faded cover stolen off a bmw R100RS that was stashed in an\\n   apartment carport and not visible from the street.  They evidently\\n   decided the beemer wasn\\'t worth stealing, but did try the next night to\\n   steal a Honda Hurricane 600 parked in the next apartment building.\\n   A neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops.\\n\\n\\nI know this is just setting myself up, but this is actually one of the\\nthings that is really good about BMW bikes.  From all accounts I\\'ve\\nheard practically no one steals BMWs. Probably it is similar for Moto\\nGuzzis and other relative \"exotics\" since there isn\\'t a large demand\\nfor parts and the bike would be much easier to track down. It seems\\nthat the most stolen bikes are Harleys and 600cc Jap sport bikes. \\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n\\nI would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of\\nthe squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the AMA before starting\\nany treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though \"accepted\", may\\nnot be necessary for the patient at the time.  And all for making a quick\\nbuck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is\\nsignificantly inflated by these \"quacks of a different color\".  In fact, I\\'d\\nsay these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the\\ntrue focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus\\non these \"quacks\" instead of devoting unbelievable energy on \\'search-and-\\ndestroy-missions\\' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non-\\ntraditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients\\nthat traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.\\n\\n\\n***************************************************\\nNow to make a general comment on many recent posts:\\n***************************************************\\n\\nLately I\\'ve seen the word \"quack\" bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor or\\ndoctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical\\nsubject in a civilized manner, all he/she has to do is say \"quack-quack\" and\\nsomehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over\\non their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teach\\nyou in medical school - how to throw your authority around?\\n\\nLet me put it another way to make my point clear:  \"quack\" is a nebulous word\\nlacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand.\\nThe indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming\\nfrom any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real\\nscary.\\n\\nBut what do I know, I\\'ve already been diagnosed by the sci.med.gods in this\\nnewsgroup as being \\'anal retentive\\', and \\'psychotic\\'.  I look forward to more\\nnet.diagnoses.  Hey, they\\'re free.\\n\\n\\nJon \"Quacks \\'R Us\" Noring\\n\\n\\n(p.s., may I suggest - seriously - that if the doctors and wanna-be-doctors on\\nthe net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and\\ntheories, such as the \"yeast theory\", should create your own moderated group.\\nYou can call it sci.med.traditional.moderated or sci.med.AMA-approved, so you\\ncan keep anal-retentives like me out of it.)\\n\\n-- \\n\\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.',\n",

       " '\\n[...]\\n\\nWait a minute, Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US \\nhas never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada \\nfrom the Cubans\\tto protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion \\nof a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).  \\nVietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess \\nwe \"invaded\" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have \\ninvaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles \\nfor anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from \\nSpain.\\n\\nSo if you mean by the word \"invaded\" some sort of military action where\\nwe cross someone\\'s border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally\\n\"invaded\" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation.\\n(If some nation \"invades\" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be\\ninvading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of\\nview, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nNo, it\\'s someone who believes in \"peace-at-all-costs\".  In other words,\\na person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and\\nCzechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one\\nwho would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political \\ndissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.\\n\\n\"Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik,\" you ask?  Well, it depends\\non what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over\\nfreedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you\\nthan life itself; if you\\'d rather die fighting for liberty than live\\nunder a tyrant\\'s heel, then yes, it\\'s \"bad\" to be a peace-nik.\\n\\nThe problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are\\nnot like them to be \"bad\" and \"unconscionable\".

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE\\n    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly\\n    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or\\n    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming\\n    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.\\n\\n    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news\\n    frequently.\\n\\n\\n    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?\\n\\n    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks\\n    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).\\n\\n    The \"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\" ASC G&C 2102,\\n\\n\\t\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is\\n\\tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\\n\\tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\\n\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\n\\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\n\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\\n\\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\\n\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\n\\tin second stage.\"\\n\\n    This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\tThis causes a little bit of\\n\\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about the\\n\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\n\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\n    It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.\\n\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\\n    are not being covered.\\n\\n\\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\\n\\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\n\\n\\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\\n\\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\\n\\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\\n\\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\\n\\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\\n\\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\\n\\n\\tStation    VHF\\t   10m\\t   15m\\t   20m\\t  40m\\t 80m\\n\\t------\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\t-----\\n\\tW6FXN\\t 145.46\\n\\tK6MF\\t 145.585\\t\\t\\t 7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tWA3NAN\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\t3.860\\n\\tW5RRR\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\t3.850\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.340  14.270\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tW1AW\\t\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\t3.990\\n\\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\\n\\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

       " \"This is turning into a FAQ\\n\\n\\nHere is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own\\nmemory.\\n\\n1)  Insert usual disclaimer here\\n \\n2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and\\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\\n    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back\\n\\tof the mac.\\n \\n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\\n    need release.\\n \\n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\\n    to release it.\\n                                            \\n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\\n\\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\\n    here.\\n\\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\\n\\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\\n\\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\\n\\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM\\n    slots.\\n\\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\\n    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their\\n\\tchips facing the front of the motherboard.\\n\\t\\n    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in\\n\\tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\\n\\tand firmly into a fully upright position.\\n\\t\\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\\n\\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\\n\\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\\n    into place.\\n\\t\\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\\n    DRIVE CABLE.\\n\\n12) Replace the phillips head screw\\n\\n13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\\n\\n14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\",\n",

       " 'To what follows, our moderator has already answered the charge of \\narrogance more ably that I could have done so, so I will confine\\nmyself to answering the charge of illogic.\\n \\n\\n\\nThis is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was,\\ntaught to think. It is the fundamental premis \"A is not not-A\". If a thing\\nis true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic \\nasumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We\\nshould distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \"believe\",\\nhowever. The weak sense means I am not sure. \"I believe Tom went to \\nthe library.\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense\\nmeans I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \"I believe \\nthat nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\" (despite \\nthe fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian\\nbelief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs\\nof the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological \\ntopics.)\\n \\n\\nNote that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the \\nmajority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that\\nif Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be\\nfalse, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity. \\n(And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)\\n \\n\\nIt is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless \\nthey have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks\\nand wants.\\n\\n\\nMost Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living\\ntradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly\\nby the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.\\n\\n\\nIf depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet\\ntall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we \\nmay both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive\\nthat he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.\\n \\n\\nThus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being \\ncan find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find \\nabsolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who\\ndoes not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.\\n\\n\\nHere I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the\\nknowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass \\nis half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half\\nfull: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole\\npoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist\\nand the optimist express the *same* fact.)\\n \\nIt is, of course, quite true that different people may express the \\nsame belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail\\nto understand each other\\'s words as expressions of the same belief\\nand may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great\\nscisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has\\nbeen done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal\\nagreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs\\nare equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict\\nsome other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations\\nof language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have\\nbeen stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must,\\n**necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical\\nto say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct, \\nbut if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long\\nas we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other \\nas in error.',\n",

       " 'Hello src readers,\\n\\nAgain the misconception that Copts among other Oriental Orthodox\\nChurches believe in Monophysitism pops up again. We had a discussion\\nabout it a while ago. \\n\\n\\nThen OFM comments :\\n\\n\\nWith my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration\\nis needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\\n\\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\\n\\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\\n\\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn\\'t  quite go the\\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\\nEvangelical Churches.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\\nMonophysitism.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\nNabil\\n\\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\\n    \\'-------------------------------------------------------------\\'\\n\\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\\nheretical probably aren\\'t.\\n\\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\\nrejected who didn\\'t intend heresy, but simply used language that was\\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\\nthe Antiochene tradition.',\n",

But this\\nstrategy wouldn\\'t get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not\\nin the near term.)\\n\\nIn other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence\\ninadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to\\ninterpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I\\'d be surprised\\nthat archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything\\nbut analogous to a wiretap by the courts.\\n\\nNote that that doesn\\'t mean I think it won\\'t be done if technically\\nfeasible.  Just as I\\'m sure many wiretaps are done now without\\nwarrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,\\nstart surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,\\ndecrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation\\ngets a boost from data that, sadly, won\\'t ever be presented to a jury.\\n\\nWhile I\\'m posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this\\narchiving scenario to extremes, read \"Lacey and his Friends\", a\\ncollection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the\\nslippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don\\'t worry folks, it\\'s\\nstored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can\\nget to it.  And by the way, we\\'ll be installing cameras on all major\\nstreets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and\\nteller machines, don\\'t we?\\n\\nAnd then we\\'ll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public\\nplaces.  Then in some private places.  Then we\\'ll make it a crime ever\\nto be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy\\ncubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and\\nafter.  But, see, there\\'s still a right to privacy.  We haven\\'t\\ncurtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it\\'d\\nbe to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a\\nVR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.\\n\\nAnd hey, nobody\\'ll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.\\n\\nAfter all, if you\\'re not doing anything illegal...\\n\\nFunny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became\\npretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn\\'t elminate all\\ncrime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds\\nof national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their\\nexecs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of\\ncompetition.

For the\\nFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called\\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of\\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\\nmatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy\\nSpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives\\nto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\\nproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of\\nthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\\nmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,\\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both.\"\\n\\t-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\\n\\nSo, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at\\nleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but\\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the\\nprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the\\nFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,\\nthe Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any\\nmention of the Son being necessary.\\n\\tIn any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope\\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\\nDamsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose\\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the\\nFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic\\nposition, which I enunciated above.\\n\\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\\nwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke\\nof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \"to produce,\\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\\nthe Fathers of Nicea.\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of\\nConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\\nConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of\\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,\\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the\\nChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy\\nSpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan\\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council\\nChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy\\nSpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves\\napproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations\\nof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work\\ndone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\\nthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\\nby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians\\nin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until\\nmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was\\nnot disputed, I provide more quotes below.\\n\\n\\t\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\\nGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly\\nclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\\nfrom it.\"\\n\\t-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial\\nTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\\nis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone\\nloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him\\'; and again it\\nis written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he\\nis none of His.\\'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the\\nHoly Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,\\nthat the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,\\' and that `He shall\\nreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.\\'\"\\n\\t-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the\\nappelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to\\nthe Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the\\nFather,\\' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,\\' and `will\\nreceive of mine,\\' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the\\nSon, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit\\ndivine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of\\nthe Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like\\nsoul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father\\nand of the Son, a third by appelation....\\n\\t\"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit\\nbreathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor\\nis the Spirit created.\"\\n\\t-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored,\\n8 and 75 (374 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is\\nit necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him,\\nit is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to\\nspeak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the\\nSon, His Sources.\"\\n\\t-St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)\\n\\n\\tThus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt,\\nPalastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time,\\nall have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine\\nexpressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church\\nthat they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus\\nwho all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is\\nnot enough to bring up the \"proceeds from the Father\" line of the Creed\\nor the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does\\nnot say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does\\nproceed from the Father.',\n",

This is how it went...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\\n\\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \\nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\\n\\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \\nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\\nwe brought up.\\n\\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \\nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \\nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \\nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \\nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \\nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\\n\\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\\nin those sectors.\\n\\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\\n\\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\\n\\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\\n\\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \\nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\\nhappen immediatly there.\\n\\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\\nreally did know the answers.\\n\\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\\n\\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\",\n",

How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were\\nI an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow\\nhouses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)\\n\\nWell, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of\\nserial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but\\nthis is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the\\npopulation, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for\\neach of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very\\nvaluable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who\\ncares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my\\npocket on two 8mm tapes.\\n\\nAdmittely, they will think of safeguards. They won\\'t put the whole\\ndatabase on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks\\nin the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day\\nby hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience\\nwill dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At\\nsome point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte\\ntapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will\\ndoubtless claim this can\\'t happen -- but we know that \"can\\'t\" is a\\nprayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.\\n\\nWith two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for\\nevery person\\'s conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you\\nneed the \"master key\" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information\\nthat have to be stored an awful lot of places.\\n\\nCome to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database\\nisn\\'t a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial\\npolitical views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the\\nones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the\\nevil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have\\na big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial\\nsecrets, so he isn\\'t being completely irrational here (although why\\nour companies couldn\\'t use cryptosystems without back doors is left\\nunexplained by those that point out this threat.) \\n\\nPresumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA\\nand other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened\\nmany times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some\\nfraction of the keys. You can\\'t avoid that sort of thing.\\n\\nDon\\'t pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on\\nthe escrow databases.\\n\\nWe crypto types are all taught something very important at the\\nbeginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the\\neasily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a\\nsecret. The escrow databases aren\\'t the sorts of secrets that our\\nteachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they\\nwould lump into this category.

My concern here is not to convince\\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\\nthere\\'s a wide enough variety of images that it\\'s possible to\\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\\nimplies that the damned don\\'t get resurrected at all.  Presumably\\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I\\'m aware that it\\'s possible to \\nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\\n\\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn\\'t eternal punishement.\\n\\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\\neternal doesn\\'t mean that people will last in its flames forever.\\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\\nthe devil, and humans?\\n\\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"?\\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.

       " '1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes.\\n--------------------------------\\nPlayoffs:\\n---------\\n*Stauber disturbed by third-man theme\\nby Rick Sadowski, Daily News\\n\\nBarry Melrose\\'s decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the\\ncrease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with\\nthe rookie goaltender.\\n\\n\"I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most\\nfun time of the year, and I\\'m not,\"  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  \"I\\nthink I have worked hard enough for that.\"\\n\\nStauber said he accepts Melrose\\'s choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie\\nin their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\\n6-3 opening victory.\\n\\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\\n\\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \\nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn\\'t played since March 29.\\n\\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey\\'s backup\\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\\nSaddledome popcorn.\\n\\n\"If I\\'m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I\\'d be\\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\\nplayoffs.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\\n\\nWhile insisting he is the Kings\\' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \\nVancouver on Thursday.\\n\\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn\\'t do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\\ngreat goalie is that he isn\\'t satisfied to be a backup.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you\\'re going to be No. 1, you\\'ve\\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You\\'ve got to be able to play when everything\\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\\nmore from him than he does.\"\\n\\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn\\'t play for a month after Knickle was signed\\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\\n\\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \\nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\\n\\n\"What I\\'ve been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn\\'t be here.\"\\n\\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn\\'t know me.  I\\'m not saying Barry \\ndoesn\\'t know me, but don\\'t say I\\'ve been without expectations.  If anything, I\\'m\\na perfectionist.\"\\n\\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \\neven though I didn\\'t play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It\\'s \\na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You\\'re almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \\nyou\\'re No. 1 and if you don\\'t you\\'re No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \\nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That\\'s what barry wanted me to explain \\nto him, why I didn\\'t come through when he counted on me.  I don\\'t know. What I \\ndo know is, it\\'s a sport.  I\\'ll be there.\"\\n\\nMelrose\\'s \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn\\'t mean much to Stauber. \"Before\\nyou know it, I\\'ll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.\\n\\n------\\n\\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \\nChannel 7 here in LA.

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\\n\\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\\nargument.\\n\\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\\nthe right tool for the job.\\n\\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\\n\\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\\n\\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\\nthree stages.\\n\\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \\n\\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\\npremises.  If something doesn\\'t seem obvious to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you\\'re right, it is obvious\" when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \\nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \\nsometimes a little confusing.\\n\\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \\nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\\nB\".  If we\\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\\nstatement is an argument.  If we\\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then\\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- This is an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\\nconclusion is true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\\n\\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All insects have wings (premise)\\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\\n\\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\\'s premises are false. \\nIf the argument\\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\\n\\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\\nas in:\\n\\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\\n\\nPremise Conclusion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \\nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\\n\\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\\n\\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \\nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\\n\\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \\nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\\'s\\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\\n\\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\'s particular circumstances.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\\n\\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\\nthe opponent\\'s argument.\\n\\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \\nYou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\\'s\\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \\nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\\nsuch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \\ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \\nconclusion accepted.  For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; I\\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\\n\\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \\nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\\nspecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\\ndislike atheists.\"\\n\\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reasons.\"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\\nconclusion reached.\\n\\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \\nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \\nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\\nfor the British Secret Services\\' official ban on homosexual employees. \\nAnother example is the classic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\\nwhen they ask questions like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\\n\\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \\nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\\n\\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBOLY\\n\\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\\n\\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\\nand\\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\\n\\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\\n\\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\\n\\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\\n\\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Isn\\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\\'t the Bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\\'t Islam a\\nform of Christianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dogs a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\\na fallacy.\\n\\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\\nanything about B.\\n\\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\\nbecause it is old, or because \"that\\'s the way it\\'s always been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\\nthan something else.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\\nalternatives exist or can exist.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nRED HERRING\\n\\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\\'s attention is diverted away from the\\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\\n\\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\\'s position so that it\\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \\ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \\nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\\n\\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\\n Martin Luther King.\"\\n\\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\\n\\n\"You\\'re just being randomly abusive.\"\\n\"So?  You\\'ve been abusive too.\"',\n",

The Greek courts \\nhave ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \\nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \\nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \\nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \\nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\\n\\nIn the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish\\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\\nof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official\\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \\nyears. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \\na vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \\ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. \\n\\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \\nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \\nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \\nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \\nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \\nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \\nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \\nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \\naccording to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'\\n\\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \\nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \\nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \\ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\\n\\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \\nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \\nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \\nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \\nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \\nof historical monuments. \\n\\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \\nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \\nHellenizing the region.\\n\\nAnd you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human \\nRights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \\nthe Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \\nof the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, \\nSidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of \\nKefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. \\nHis employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in \\n24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \\ninvolvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice \\nand remains without a job. \\n\\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \\nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \\nfindings were published in a report titled \\n\\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\\n\\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \\nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \\nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \\nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \\nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \\nLausanne Convention. \\n\\nThe Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik\\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in\\nKarotas was razed by bulldozers.\\n\\nShall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going \\nto take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The \\ndiscussion of human rights violations in Greece does not \\nstop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles \\nI shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks\\nin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration \\nhas an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made \\nplans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it \\nhas to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on \\nconventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek \\nand Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned \\nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \\ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \\nCyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \\nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.\\n\\nAn acceptable method may certainly be found when there\\nis a will. But we know of various kinds of violent\\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\\nof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were \\ndragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. \\nShots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.\\n\\nNow wait, there is more.\\n\\n  'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited\\n  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by\\n  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,\\n  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).\\n\\n  pages 82-83:\\n\\n<< 1.

       " '[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]\\n\\nGun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day\\nwith a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30.\\nIt was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began,\\nwhereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from\\nwherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.\\n\\nMike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to\\nremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been\\nchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the\\npeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of\\n\"election fraud\" to hold their jobs.\\n\\nNancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and\\nsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and\\ntelling people where to find their own representatives (and in too\\nmany cases, who they were).\\n\\nMike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and\\ndiscuss a bill that hadn\\'t made it onto the official list.  It seems a\\ndelegation of students from Simon\\'s Rock of Bard College (alma mater\\nof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was\\nbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or\\nammo to anyone who is not a state resident.\\n\\nThe hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner\\nAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor\\'s\\nhearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive\\nhusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole\\nour representatives, after which we would be squashed into an\\ninadequate hearing room.\\n\\nOne of my representatives\\' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.\\nHe said, \"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is\\nalways so organized every year.\"  I got a little pissed, and replied,\\n\"I\\'m not from the gun lobby -- I\\'m from your district.\"\\n\\nAt 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\\npro-gunners weren\\'t).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his\\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\\nseveral Simon\\'s Rock anti-gun \"close-the-loophole\" protestors.\\n(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)\\n\\nThe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were\\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\\nfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A\\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\\ncrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\\n\\nEveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up\\nto \"support GOAL\\'s position\" on \"all bills.\"\\n\\nFirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\\ntestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\\nhad some curfew, I guess).  \\n\\nCurrently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\\nhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\\nnon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon\\'s Rock\\nfolks called the current law a \"loophole\" and wanted it closed.\\n\\nTwo of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \"SKS assault rifle.\"\\nThe second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\\nthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo\\'s home state) with Missouri,\\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\\ncorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed\\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\\nstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \"as strong as\"\\nthat in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that\\'s that.\\n\\nSome of the things these two said were really offensive.  \"In some of\\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he\\'s breathing!\"\\n(Oooooo!)  \"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if\\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn\\'t\\nbe having this situation -- but they won\\'t.\"  (Naughty, naughty!)\\n\\nNext up was Boston city councilman Albert \"Dapper\" O\\'Neill.  He was\\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He\\'s\\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he\\'s\\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the\\nACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\\njudge, he\\'d give arrestees their \"last rights\" (pun intended) on the\\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\\nHe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\\nright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(\\n\\nTwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\\nCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\\nrestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining\\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\\n-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor\\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\\n\"I\\'m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\\nconvicted.\"  I haven\\'t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\\nperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn\\'t a crook.\\n\\nBarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable\\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated\\npurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.\\n\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some\\ncongressmen think we\\'re stupid enough to swallow the argument that\\nit\\'s preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the\\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\\n\\nThe two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.\\nJujuga didn\\'t say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \"restraining\\norder\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn\\'t let any\\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He \\nwas a co-sponsor of one of the \"restraining order\" bills as well.)  One\\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in\\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \"every\\nyear it\\'s the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\"\\nIt\\'s nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\\nmore effective.\\n\\nAt about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn\\'t continue.\\nSomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\\ndisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had\\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \"public\"\\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\\n\\nCaron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the\\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\\nHe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\\nhis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great\\nquote: \"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\\ncomputer system until 1999.\"  (This was also an argument he used\\nagainst the renewable FID card.)\\n\\nTestimony was heard from several \"battered women,\" one of whom had\\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20\\'s who had an FID card because he\\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and\\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General\\nHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\\nneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was\\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\\nthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be\\nsatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\\nthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long\\nrambling circumlocution in response.\\n\\nThen testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks\\nsomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\\nAtty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\\n\\nOther pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a\\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\\ncountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have\\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\\nOne of the junior reps noted that \"this is America\" and we have to be\\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga\\nreiterated this, saying that \"people who abuse smaller people can go\\nto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating\\nconviction with a restraining order.\"  (Point and match, Senator.)\\n\\nAnother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn\\'t know his\\ncitizenship \"expired every 5 years,\" and that a driver\\'s license was a\\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\\n\\nA third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\\nhangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\\nhangings.  The speaker then responded, \"I\\'ll make you a deal.  You get\\nme the rope, and I\\'ll tie the noose.\"\\n\\nNext came public testimony on the Simon\\'s Rock bill.  A teacher\\ntestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \"he\\nwouldn\\'t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\\noutside\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \"loophole\" should be\\nclosed to prevent something like this from \"ever happening again\".\\n\\nFour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually\\nshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,\\nsaying, \"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\\nsafe -- support gun control.\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or\\ncorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had\\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \"Only residents can get\\nFID\\'s,\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no\\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\\nout-of-staters completely off?)\\n\\nYacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\\nwritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by\\nout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could\\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary\\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino\\nunderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident\\nstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental\\nrecord.\\n\\nOne junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy\\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \"elitist\".

       " 'Dean Velasco quoted a letter from James M Stowell, president of\\nMoody Bible Institute:\\n\\n\\n\\nThere has been a lot of discussion, but so far nobody seems to have hit on\\nexactly what the criticism of \"arrogance\" is aimed at.\\n\\nThe arrogance being attacked is that we \"think we are the only ones who know\\nwhat the absolutes are\".  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are\\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\\n\\nIn particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can\\nthink of epistemology as \"how do you know?\"  That question, it turns out, is\\na very troubling one.\\n\\nThe problem with `absolute certainty\\' is that, at the bottom, at least some of\\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that\\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\\n\\nAnd that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of\\nauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional\\nInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of\\nPapal Infallibility, too.)\\n\\nZeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and\\nseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and\\npossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute\\nTruth.\\n\\nHe may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.\\nHis conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made\\nmistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His\\nconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made\\nmistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made\\nmistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)\\n\\nEverything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that\\nhappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what\\nhe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own\\ninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own\\nreasoning, that belief cannot be considered \"absolutely certain\".\\n\\nZeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief\\nis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can\\nsay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.\\n\\nAny belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on\\nyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible\\nthinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.\\n\\n\\nThis is easy to demonstrate.  Let\\'s go back to our shorthand method of doing\\nepistemology: \"how do you know?\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:\\n\\n A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.\\n\\n B: How do you know?\\n\\n A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church\\n    teachings and came to this conclusion.\\n\\n B: How do you know you studied history correctly?\\n\\n A: Well, I double-checked everything.\\n\\n B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?\\n\\n A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.\\n\\n B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn\\'t mean it is\\n    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?\\n\\n A: ...\\n\\nAnd, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \"I\\ncan\\'t prove that there are no mistakes\" -- and as long as you may have made a\\nmistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.\\n\\nThere is no way out of the loop.\\n\\n\\nThis is where the \"arrogance of Christians\" arises: many people believe\\nthat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the\\ndoctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are\\ninfallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.\\n\\nClaiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led\\nyou to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.\\n\\n *\\n\\nPeople who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to\\nfind _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking\\nthe idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),\\nbut the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is\\nknowably Inerrant.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\\n\\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\\nvacuum.\\n\\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\\ndifference and the products of combustion.\\n\\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\\n\\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\\n\\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------',\n",
       " '\\n\\nNo matter how \"absurd\" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by\\nmankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common\\nmoral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of\\nany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a\\nworkable moral system created for everyday use.\\n\\nThe Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing\\nevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it.

A max of 65K\\n   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB\\n   VRAM.\\n\\n2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:\\n\\n   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an\\n      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often\\n      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to\\n      be.\\n\\n   b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the\\n      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you\\n      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).\\n\\n3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development\\n   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger\\n   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the\\n   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed\\n   to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The\\n   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.\\n\\n   Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen\\n   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter\\n   \"R\". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it\\n   does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn\\'t have to do this.\\n\\n   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive\\n   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with\\n   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles\\n   the VGA mode.\\n   \\n   The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use\\n   another monitor in place of my usual one.\\n\\nI still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be\\nremedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).\\n',\n",

How do I become an astronaut?\\n\\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it\\'s probably\\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you\\'re better off hoping to\\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \"mission\\n    specialist\".\\n\\n    If you aren\\'t a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA\\'s problem is not finding qualified people,\\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\\tIt is not enough\\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\\n\\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\\n\\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\\t(DO NOT get a\\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\\n    you should be okay; if you can\\'t, your chances are poor.\\n\\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\\n    appearance and actions; you\\'ve got a tough selling job ahead, trying\\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA\\'s image is very prim and\\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\\n    Keep your nose clean.\\n\\n    Get a pilot\\'s license and make flying your number one hobby;\\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\\n\\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \"you\\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\".\\n\\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\\n    to demonstrate motivation.\\n\\n    Keep trying.

Johnson Space Center\\n    Houston, Texas\\n\\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\\n    ==================================================================\\n\\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\\n    ---------------------------\\n\\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\\n\\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\\n    considered.\\n\\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\\n    program.\\n\\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\\n    ---------------------------------\\n\\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\\n    flight crew.\\n\\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\\n    government agencies and private industries.\\n\\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\\n    astronauts.\\n\\n    Pilot Astronaut\\n\\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\\n    payload operations.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\\n\\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\\n    experimental operations.\\n\\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\\n    ===========================\\n\\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\\n    --------------------------------\\n\\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\\n    submitting an application.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\\n\\n    1.

Applications received after that date will be retained and\\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\\n\\n    Active Duty Military\\n\\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\\n\\n    Selection\\n    ---------\\n\\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\\n\\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\\n    their establishment.\\n\\n    General Program Requirements\\n\\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\\n    their candidate period.\\n\\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\\n    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not\\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA\\n    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\\n    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a\\n    specified tour of duty.\\n\\n    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\\n    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\\n\\n    Pay and Benefits\\n    ----------------\\n\\n    Civilians\\n\\n    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal\\n    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,\\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\\n    and experience.\\n\\n    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\\n\\n    Military\\n\\n    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center\\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\\n    other similar military matters.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nYes, it\\'s important to realize that all actions have consequences,\\nand that \"rules\" were made for our own good.  But to suggest that a\\n*disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is \\ntaking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease\\nfor lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed\\nblindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare\\nsay all of us would be walking into walls.\\n\\nYes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real*\\ncareful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for \\nsin.  The Jews of Jesus\\'s time believed that all sickness was the\\nresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was\\nblind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any\\nother STD is a *punishment\" for sexual sin, what do we do with \\ndiseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as\\ndebilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a\\nspecific behavior or lifestyle?\\n\\nAtonement is *extremely* important, but I think you\\'ve missed the mark\\nabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.\\nThe atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central\\nmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,\\nand was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of\\nour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for\\nour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He\\nhas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or \\nsome other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting\\non the sacrifice that Jesus made.\\n\\nIn case you couldn\\'t tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when\\nI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and\\nphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other\\nsocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through\\ntheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,\\nno more and no less than we do.  I\\'ve said this before, but I think\\nit\\'s a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus\\nhealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on\\nthis earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.\\nShe has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed \\nrelationship with God.  Her theology isn\\'t what I would want it to be,\\nbut God\\'s grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining\\nweight (she\\'s had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is\\nexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes\\nher improvement in her health to God\\'s intervention in her life.  Who\\nare we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-\\nwork, and left for the Zhdanov District. That\\'s in Azerbaijan, near the\\nNagorno Karabagh region.\\n\\nAfter the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically\\nin Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said \"uprising\" in\\nAzerbaijani, but I don\\'t think it was really an uprising, just a \\ndemonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the \\nZhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even \\nwomen; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, \\nand went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There\\nwere some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the\\nArmenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.\\nI was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew \\nwouldn\\'t let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really \\nbad. I didn\\'t know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,\\n\"There\\'s unrest everywhere, be careful.\" Well I had a project going on. I told\\nthe Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on \\nand said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn\\'t allow it, they \\nsaid, \"Nothing\\'s going to happen to you, we\\'ve entrusted the matter to the \\npolice, we\\'ve warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\" \\nWell, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he \\nknows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This\\nman didn\\'t leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and \\nafterward he spent the night with us, too.\\n\\nI sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \"The situation is\\nvery tense, be careful.\"\\n\\nWe finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the\\nmorning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I\\nshouldn\\'t tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else\\'s\\nbusiness travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it \\nand my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus, \\nthey sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that\\nthey had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out \\nthey knew what was happening in Sumgait.\\n\\nI arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is\\nclosed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the \\nbuses aren\\'t running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two\\nminutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private\\ndrivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, \"Let\\'s go find some other way to get\\nthere.\" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to\\ntake us to Sumgait.\\n\\nHe took us there. But the others had said, \"I wouldn\\'t go if you gave me a\\nthousand rubles.\" \"Why?\" \"Because they\\'re burning the city and killing the\\nArmenians. There isn\\'t an Armenian left.\" Well I got hold of myself so I could\\nstill stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we \\nset off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, \"In fact there aren\\'t any\\nArmenians left. \\'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\" Well \\nI was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me, \\n\"How old are you, old man?\" He wants to know: if I\\'m being that quiet, not \\nsaying anything, maybe it means I\\'m an Armenian. \"How old are you?\" he asks \\nme. I say, \"I\\'m 47.\" \"I\\'m 47 too, but I call you \\'old man\\'.\" I say, \"It \\ndepends on God, each person\\'s life in this world is different.\" I look much\\nolder than my years, that\\'s why he called me old man. Well after that he was\\nsilent, too.\\n\\nWe\\'re approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.\\nBefore we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he\\nwas waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I\\'m sitting there with\\nthem, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant\\nthere were no Armenians with us.\\n\\nI look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the \\nstreet, you know, and there\\'s no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They\\nstopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature \\nshafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .\\n\\nAlong the way the driver tells us how they know who\\'s an Armenian and who\\'s \\nnot. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I\\'m an Armenian, but I speak \\ntheir language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for \\n\"nut,\" or \"little nut,\" as \"pundukh,\" but \"fundukh\" is actually correct. The \\npronunciations are different. Anyone who says \"pundukh,\" even if they\\'re not \\nArmenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says, \\n\"There was a car there, with five people inside it,\" he says. \"They started \\nhitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn\\'t let the\\npeople out,\" he says, \"they wouldn\\'t let them get out of the car.\" I only saw \\nthe car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from\\nBaku to Sumgait and back . . .\\n\\nWhen they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there\\'s a short guy,\\nhis eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in\\nthe other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \"We\\'re\\nAzerbaijani,\\' they tell him, \\'no Armenians here.\" He did come up to me when \\nwe were pulling our things out and says, \"Maybe you\\'re an Armenian, old man?\" \\nBut in Azerbaijani I say, \"You should be ashamed of yourself!\" And . . . he \\nleft. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had \\nto . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own \\nhome.\\n\\nThey stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that\\'s where the Kavkaz store \\nand three large, 12-story buildings are. That\\'s the beginning of down-town. I \\nsaw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I \\ncouldn\\'t figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it \\nwas a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing \\nremained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I\\nsaw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About\\n30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.\\n\\nI see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are\\nclosed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the\\ncrowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it\\'s true, but pistol shots.\\nSeveral shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. \\nSomeone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the \\nsoldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one \\narmored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning \\noff Sumgait.\\n\\nI walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by \\ntheir gait that they\\'re not bandits, they\\'re just people, walking home. I\\njoined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us\\nand asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.\\nBut I avoided the large groups because I\\'m a local and might be quickly \\nrecognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer\\npeople. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.\\nI can\\'t get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as \\nto get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking \\nbehind him. And he\\'s shouting into a megaphone: \"Comrades, the Armenian-\\nAzerbaijani war has begun!\"\\n\\nThe police have megaphones like that. So they\\'re talking and walking around \\nthe second microdistrict. I see that they\\'re coming my way, and turn off \\nbehind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, \\nand inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every\\ncorner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were \\ndoing I can\\'t say, because I couldn\\'t get up close to them, I was afraid. But \\nthe most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least\\nfind out if my children were alive or not . . .\\n\\n   April 20, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

       " '\\nAs a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran - it is some of the\\n\"innovations\" of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and return\\nto the more traditional Catholic Chuch - the Lutherans.\\n\\nI spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate in\\nthe Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish just\\ninstituted the \"Tenebrae\" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for \\na paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things\\nthat I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those \"facts\" were\\nalways there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking about\\nthe differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over\\nbreakfast Easter Sunday.\\n\\nMy wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music\\nand worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee\\nbut listens very carefully to the committee\\'s suggestions.  It needs a strong\\nhand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong\\nas it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional\\nreason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual\\nguidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA \"wishy-washy\".\\n \\nAs you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-\\nregardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes\\nthe true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a\\ntraditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament\\nof PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.\\nThe reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings\\nare not shared by everyone.\\n\\nI want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don\\'t want \\nthem attending a show.  It\\'s not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful\\nservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of\\nWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such\\nas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it\\nis Not there.\\n\\nQuite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and \"fit in\".\\nMy dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils\\nwould intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who\\nhave beared with me this far understand what I mean.\\n\\nPlease keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not\\nto worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something\\nwrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or\\npastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn\\'t listen.  They are there to \\nprovide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences with\\nthe Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change\\nfaiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and\\nministers.\\n\\nIn Christ,\\nKershner\\n-- \\nKershner Wyatt\\nkwyatt@ccscola.ColumbiaSC.ncr.com',\n",

       " '\\nI agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a\\nwaste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.\\n\\nFor example, I recently was asking some children the question \"What temperature\\ndoes water boil at?\"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked\\nif they knew what scale, and was told \"It\\'s just 212 degrees.  Any scale.\\nThat\\'s what all thermometers say.\"  Well, that\\'s sincere, and may be\\ntrue in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT\\nan absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should\\nnurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth\\nand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time\\nand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion\\neasily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of \\nthe indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.\\n \\n[example of head-covering in Church deleted]\\n\\nThis was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the\\nwriting, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the\\ninstructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.\\nThe instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first\\ncentury culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having\\na LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I \\nsee no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.\\n \\n\\nEven the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally.\\nI\\'ve yet to meet anyone who takes the verse \"blessed is he who takes your\\nbabies and smashes their heads against the rocks\" literally.  The Bible\\nwas not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us\\nwhat parts should be interpreted which way. \\n \\n\\nI agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be \\nable to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another.\\nThe presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I\\nknow I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.\\n\\nI can\\'t prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience.\\nI also trust God\\'s revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite.\\nTherefore we can\\'t comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don\\'t need them.  \\nI can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which\\nGod is manifested to God\\'s creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE\\nabsolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It\\'s like claiming that the\\noriginal scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell.\\nWho cares?  It doesn\\'t affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as \\nwell believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they\\nlive on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on \\nhow I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that\\ncafeteria for lunch?  No.  \\n\\nThis attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians\\nare arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true,\\nwonderful and sensible.

       " '\\nThe existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not\\nmean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds.\\nThere is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I\\ndid not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual over\\nanother as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not\\npreclude that the development of that individual into what he is in\\nthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.\\n\\nI do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view\\nof an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that\\nbefalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater\\nlaw in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the\\nultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of\\nChrist can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that\\nwas completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the\\nflesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental\\nconcepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized\\nand mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus\\nChrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.\\nTheir teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the\\ncontinuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).\\nMore important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,\\nthe ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate\\nresurrection and judgement on the Last Day.\\n\\nThere is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the\\ntenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.\\nClearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma\\nor that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a\\nnew impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not\\nrefute the disciples\\' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of\\ncourse, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only\\none of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man\\nhimself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his\\nparents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at\\nall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of\\nChrist\\'s answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.\\n\\nThere is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John\\nthe Baptist,\\n\\n   \"If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.\"\\n\\nThis also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching\\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to\\nthe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did\\nnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\"If\\nyou care to accept it\").  So I took care to point out, not that the\\nBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and\\nthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes\\nunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I\\npointedly used \"repeated earth lives\" to distinguish a little from the\\noriental doctrines usually associated with the word \"reincarnation\".\\nThe phrase is Rudolf Steiner\\'s (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too\\nthat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely\\nfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth\\ncenturies, the most important expression of it being Lessing\\'s \"The\\nEducation of the Human Race\".\\n\\nTo return to your original point, Paul\\'s statement about Jacob and\\nEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.\\nAnd both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the\\nincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus\\nChrist, in my view.',\n",

If we are going to get anywhere in \\nthis (or any) discussion, it doesn\\'t help to bring up elements I never \\naddressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is \\n\"right\" or who is \"wrong\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover \\nand that, having been placed \"in between\" the Israelis and the guerillas,\\nthey *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.\\n \\n\\t[The *purpose* of an army\\'s use of military uniforms \\n\\tis *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that \\n\\tcivilians will not be thought of by the other side as\\n\\t\"combatants\". So, what do you think is the \"meaning behind\", \\n\\tthe intention and the effect when an \"army\" purposely \\n\\t*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look \\n\\tlike civilians\\'? *They are judging that the benefit they will \\n\\treceive from this \"cover\" is more important that the harm\\n\\tthat will come to civilians.*\\n\\nThis is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying\\nthat the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians\\nin \"the middle\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart\\nfrom civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower\\nthe risk to civilians.\\n\\n\\tBut if the guerillas do this aren\\'t *they* putting themselves\\n\\tat greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \"why set \\n\\tourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made \\n\\tcover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of \\n\\tview, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept \\n\\tsome of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.\\n\\n\\nI agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel\\'s bombing\\nsortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND\\nineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait \\nuntil attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that\\n\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\" will do more to stop attacks. \\n\\nAs I said previously, Israel spent several decades \"sitting passively\"\\non its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*\\nthe attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn\\'t work very well.\\nThe \"host\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks \\nfrom its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks\\nwere considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact \\non the civilians caught in their path.  \\n\\nThis is just another \"selectively applied\" statement.\\n \\nThe reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis\\nis that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your\\ncriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.\\n\\nThat is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for \\nthe \"interim\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are\\ndemanding conditions that essentially define \"autonomy\" already. They DO\\nNOT trust that Israel will \"follow through\" the entire process and allow\\nPalestinians to reach full autonomy. \\n\\nDo you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? \\nIf you do, then why should Israel\\'s view of Arabs/Palestinians \\nbe any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians\\' words?\\nSince they don\\'t, they are VERY reluctant to give up \"tangible assets \\n(land, control of areas) in exchange for \"words\". For this reason,\\nthey are also concerned about the sorts of \"guarantees\" they will have \\nthat the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.\\n\\nAbsolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the\\nIsraelis \"word\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being\\ndemanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party\\nfinally gets HOLD of this \"land\", what the \"other party\" does\\nis totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land,\\nyour words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to\\nkeeps its word does NOT get the land back.\\n\\n\\nWhile the \"major armaments\" (those allowing people to wage \"civil wars\")\\nhave been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still\\nremain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \"commando\"\\nraids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard\\nfor human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.\\n\\n\\nBat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks\\nwere commonplace.\\n\\n\\nThere is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \"disarmed\" UNLESS the state\\nis as authoritarian is Syria\\'s. The only other way is for Lebanon to take\\nit upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially\\nmirroring Israel\\'s border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that\\nit is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.\\n\\nThat\\'s what I said, ok? But, doesn\\'t that mean that Syria has to \"take over\"\\nLebanon? I don\\'t think Israel or Lebanon would like that.\\nWhat both \"sides\" need is to receive something \"tangible\". The Arabs/\\nPalestinians are looking for \"land\" and demanding that they receive it\\nprior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it\\ngives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic\\nsituation (and that change doesn\\'t help Israel\\'s position), and 2) WHEN\\nit gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to\\ncompensate for the increased risks',\n",

However, who is at blame is another question.\\nIt seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions--\\nrealizing the risks--is to blame.\\n\\n\\nYes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing\\nany raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally\\nfrom the rest of society because of this.\\n\\n\\nAnd I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent\\nperson will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact,\\nmany criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment\\nof innocents.\\n\\n\\nBut, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals\\non the road.

But, the question is whether or not\\nall such \"murders\" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life\\nis wrong, no matter what the circumstances?\\n\\n\\nBut, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an\\ninnocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of\\nsociety shares this blame.  And, most people\\'s definitions of murder\\ninclude some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an\\nexecution, is it?\\n\\n\\nMurder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing\\nit at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the\\ninnocent victim is.\\n\\n\\nReading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction\\nwas moral or not.

Digital immortality.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind \"digital immortality\" is that computer networks   \\nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\\'ll be put in different\\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\\'ll be\\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \\n \\nIf that doesn\\'t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \\nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it\\'s stimulus, it will \\ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\\n \\nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \\nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\\ncopies of the images to look at when you\\'ve got the gumption...\\nthat\\'s what they\\'re here for.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWHERE?             \\n\\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \\n \\n \\t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \\n\\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\\n\\nMerely \"anonymous FTP\" to either site on Internet and change to the\\nappropriate directory.  Don\\'t forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\\ncommand to make sure you\\'re in binary.\\n\\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\\nOTIStuff...\\n\\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\\n\\tCyberDen (SanFran?)

After the image is received,\\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\\nare also welcome.\\n\\nOTIS\\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \\nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \\nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \\nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\\ntougher to find.  If you can\\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \\nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \\nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \\n\\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \\n\\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\\'ll\\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \\ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \\nemailing).\\n\\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\\ncopies to:\\n\\nThe OTIS Project\\nc/o Ed Stastny\\nPO BX 241113\\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\\n\\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \\nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \\nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \\ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\\ndirectory where it\\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \\n \\nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\\ncontact me and we\\'ll arrange things.\\n\\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\\nThis is good for people who don\\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\\nJPG.  If you can\\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\\'d just rather\\nnot have to.\\n\\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\\ncan stand.

It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.

That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.

       " 'I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God coming\\ndown to earth to live as one of us \"subject to sin and death\" (as one of\\nthe consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was\\nthat Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the\\nbasic definition of humanity, then Jesus \"fully human\" (Nicea) would not\\nbe \"subject to sin\", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,\\nbecause we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish\\nbetween \"human\" and \"fallen human\" makes Jesus less like one of us at the\\ntime we need him most.\\n\\n\\nFirst, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius\\'s version -- they \\nwere on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical\\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \\nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius\\'s\\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\\na la Chalcedon.\\n\\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\\nthat Jesus\\'s human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\\nprevailed.\\n\\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\\n\\nJason Albert\\n\\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn\\'t see how we could call\\nJesus fully human, because he didn\\'t sin.  I completely agree that\\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\\n\\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\\'s reason to think\\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\\ngot the better of them.\\n\\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\\nmust be understood that there\\'s a certain indirectness in the Logos\\'\\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don\\'t have an\\nincarnation at all.

To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

It\\'s not a definite,\\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn\\'t take into account that Viola\\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\\nanalysis?

Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-\\ngauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of\\n19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge\\nshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of\\n24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel\\nlength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver\\nis reported to have said that he could perform better work once\\nhis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility\\nof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars\\nfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty\\ndollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have\\nsimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -\\nover a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).\\n\\nThe next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that\\nhis \"source\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead\\nof the one-hundred fifty he\\'d promised.  At this point, Weaver\\nsuspected he was dealing with an informant, \"I had a guy in\\nSpokane tell me you were bad.\"  Fadeley managed to convince\\nWeaver otherwise.\\n\\nThe _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were\\nmade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these\\nmeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also\\nreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki\\nWeaver (Randy Weaver\\'s wife) was played to the court.  There must\\nhave also been phone taps.\\n\\nThese tapes were played to the court via both headphones and\\nloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver\\'s\\nattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to\\nmake sure that the government proved its case, \"...if it has a\\ncase at all...\" according to the rules.\\n\\nRandy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his\\nwife\\'s voice on the tape.\\n\\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear\\naccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the\\nWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect\\nthis trial is not explained.\\n\\nOther notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning\\nKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are\\nsurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were\\nsurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained\\nin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy\\nWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that\\nHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report\\nthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming\\nat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics\\nare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the\\nonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and\\nDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that\\nHarris\\'s survival is simply due to divine intervention.',\n",

For example, there are a few chaps who are \\ntrying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the\\nerror in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed \\nlight has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been \\naccounted for. :-] )\\n\\n\\nOr (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never \\nintended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one\\nup?\\n\\n\\nMillions of people have \"died for a lie\".  This  point is difficult to \\nsubstantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments\\nwork in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed \\nthemselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory\\nof the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.\\n\\n  \\nThat is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone)\\nto become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to\\nthe claim that Jesus was the \"real thing\".\\n\\n\\n\\nHave you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the\\npoint, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his\\nmany colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based \\n(I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with \\nhis principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler\\nwas sane....\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nHmmm.... I don\\'t think his arguments warrant the use of a \"Therefore...\"\\n\\n\\nThis is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with\\npeople result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think\\npeople can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of\\nmetaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to\\npresent.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or\\nshe will end up in all sorts of shit.   \\n\\nTony\\'s argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe\\nthe events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone, \\nwho thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the\\nbook is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \"a is\\nequal to b because a is equal to b\".\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nThat would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed \\nin religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all\\nclaiming to be correct.  \\n\\nIt \\n\\nI think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames\\nthan here :-).

       " 'According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking \"in X\\'s\\nname\" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today\\nwould call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus\\' culture authorized\\nto conduct business \"in John\\'s name\" had full authority over John\\'s\\nfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to\\nwork only for John\\'s benefit and consonant with John\\'s wishes.  It was\\nnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with\\n\"in John\\'s name\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney\\nand be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal\\nand religious definitions of \"faith\".)\\n\\nWith this cultural background, praying \"in Jesus\\' name\" does not\\nmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the\\npetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous\\n\"fiduciary\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His\\nKingdom.  The message of \"praying in Jesus\\' name\" is thus closely\\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God\\'s\\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\\nresponsibilities.  This idea of praying \"in Jesus\\' name\" is not only\\npresent but prominent in the Lord\\'s Prayer, although the verbal\\nforumula is absent.\\n\\nThe act of praying the words \"In Jesus\\' Name\" may be beneficial if\\nthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the\\nadvancement of God\\'s Kingdom.  For that reason, I\\'m not quite ready\\nto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.\\n\\nPrayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,\\netc.) don\\'t seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by\\nChristian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that\\'s B.C.E. or\\nC.E. for you P.C. :-).

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard\\nScanjet IIp was purchased this week.\\n\\nThank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:\\n\\nJohn Sorenson\\nCarol Sigelman\\nCarla Moore\\nBarbara Moose\\nJudith Schrier\\n\\nAgain, thank you to all who gave!\\n\\nI have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to \\nreview the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \\nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \\nPackard Scanners.  \\n\\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \\n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \\nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \\n\\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \\nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\\n\\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \\nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were \\nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \\nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn\\'t think it converted \\ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \\ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \\nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \\ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \\nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \\n\\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \\nprocessor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a \\nseperate TIFF or PCX file format.\\n\\nI was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nan Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.  \\nWhile most of my faxes were received in \"standard\" mode (200x100 dpi), the \\naccuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent. \\n\\nOverall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the \\nlimitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just \\ntoo small. \\n\\nIf anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n               Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - MMWR\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n                         Emerging Infectious Diseases\\n                         ============================\\n                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993\\n\\n                                 Introduction\\n\\n     Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would \\nsoon be eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain \\nthe major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in \\nthe United States. Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \\nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \\nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \\nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \\nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \\nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \\ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \\nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \\nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \\ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \\nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \\nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \\nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \\neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \\n(3). \\n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \\nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \\nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \\npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \\nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \\n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \\nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \\nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \\ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \\npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \\nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \\n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \\n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \\nwas initiated. \\n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \\nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \\ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \\n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \\nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \\nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \\nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \\na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \\nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \\ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \\n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \\n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \\nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \\n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \\nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \\n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \\n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \\nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \\nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \\nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \\nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \\nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \\nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \\n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \\npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \\nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \\n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \\noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \\npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \\nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \\nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \\ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \\nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \\nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \\nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \\n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \\nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \\nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \\ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \\ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \\nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \\nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \\nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \\nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \\none patient 38 days after illness onset. \\n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \\nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \\n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \\nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \\nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \\nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \\n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \\nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \\n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \\nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \\nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \\nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \\n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \\n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \\nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \\nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \\nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \\nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \\n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \\nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \\n\\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \\nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \\nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \\nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \\nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children\\'s Hospital and \\nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \\nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \\nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \\ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \\nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \\nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \\nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \\nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \\nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \\nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \\nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \\n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \\nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \\nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \\n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \\nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \\ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \\ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \\nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \\n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \\noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \\nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \\nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \\n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \\npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \\nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \\nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \\nhealth action to prevent further cases. \\n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \\ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \\nDepartment of Agriculture\\'s Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \\ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \\nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \\nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \\npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \\nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \\ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \\nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \\nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \\nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \\nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \\n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \\n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \\nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \\nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \\noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \\nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \\ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \\ncoli O157:H7. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Long-term use of \\nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \\noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \\ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \\nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \\nCDC\\'s 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \\nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \\ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \\nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \\nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \\n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \\ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \\nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \\nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \\nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \\ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \\nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \\ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \\nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \\nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \\nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \\nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \\nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \\nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \\nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \\nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \\n(3). \\n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \\nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \\nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \\nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \\nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \\nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \\nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \\nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks.

Although \\nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \\namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \\n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \\nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \\nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \\naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \\n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \\nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \\nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \\n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \\n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \\ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \\nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \\nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \\n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \\n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\\n49.6). \\n\\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \\nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \\nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \\ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \\nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \\nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \\nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \\nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \\nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \\n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \\nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \\nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \\nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \\nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \\ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \\n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \\nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \\nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \\nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \\nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \\nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \\nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \\nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \\n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \\npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \\ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \\n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \\nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \\nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \\ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \\nenforcing laws that restrict minors\\' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \\ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \\nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \\nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \\ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

       " 'Dear Rob,\\n\\n\\nSometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that\\nway at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I\\'ll\\ntry to get better.\\n\\nRob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle\\napproach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,\\nonly responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both\\ncases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse\\nfor myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.\\n\\nRob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. \\nvasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is\\nan excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  \\nI think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with\\nhis set of excuses.  \\n\\nI just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants\\nto know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses\\nwhich have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the\\nBible for himself and come to his own decisions without being\\nsidetracked with the temptation to mock God.\\n\\nFrom my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man\\nstanding out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I \\nsee a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away\\nfrom the oncoming truck.  He doesn\\'t see it.   Here\\'s is how I see\\nthe dialog:\\n\\n\\nMe:  \"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\" \\n\\nBK:  \"There is no truck.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Turn around at look.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at\\n     the oncoming truck.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Turn around or you will run over.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No. I won\\'t because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing\\n      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\"\\n      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.\\n\\nBK:  \"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.\\n      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\"\\n      And by the way, I really have an open mind.\"\\n\\n\\nSo is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   \\n\\nI do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not\\nbillions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people\\nfall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.\\nI can now see the truck behind Brian.\\n\\nMy hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the\\ntruck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out\\nof the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself\\nto the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if\\nhe so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that\\nto change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,\\nBrian hasn\\'t gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he\\ndoes not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his\\nhead will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is\\nsatisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. ',\n",

       " '\\nOh contrer mon captitan!  There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.\\n Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase\\nSartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It\\nis only because of God\\'s own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing. \\nYour logic comes to fruition in relativism.  \\n\\nAh, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig\\'s fame is often\\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\\n(\\'21) and Philosophical Investigation (\\'53).  Many of Witt\\'s comments and\\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt\\'s\\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt\\'s own\\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\\na threshold.\\n  vonWrights\\'s comment that Witt\\'s \"sentences have a content that often lies\\ndeep beneath the surface of language.\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the\\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\\nWitt\\'s own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \\nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\\n\\n  This is why John\\'s Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\\nhe is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn\\'t shy from this, a mysticism to\\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\\nand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy\\'s Sweetie\\'s conclusion because\\nif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  \\n\\n\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would\\nsay unto me.\"  Job 23ff\\n\\n--Rex',\n",

Where did _that_ topic come from and what\\'s it got to do\\nwith the discussion at hand? :-)\\n\\nWhen I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes\\nagainst different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws which\\nallow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the\\nconvict\\'s attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit\\ninto that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that of\\nthe standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender,\\nethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask about\\nclasses based upon one\\'s _profession_ rather than one\\'s personal\\ncharacteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the question\\nfrom scratch.\\n\\nWhat I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such\\nclasses because to do so would be to formally and officially declare\\nsome people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema\\nto the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.\\n\\nLast year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would\\nhave expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus\\ncrimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not\\nprotected by that \"aura of deterrence,\" critics pointed out the\\nabsurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the\\nmurder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a\\ncivilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more\\nvalueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society.\\nThis was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of\\nthat viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge\\nsome lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their\\n\"contribution to society.\"  I view that doctrine as being both (a)\\npersonally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of\\nthe 14th Amendment.\\n\\nAccordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give any\\nprofession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism\\nof supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of\\nthat class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking\\nmembers of the Executive Branch of the federal government.',\n",

       " 'Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the\\n_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television\\nstation, KTVB Channel 7.\\n\\nRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.\\n\\nFriday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.\\n\\nSynopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent\\nCooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald\\nHowen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\\n\\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\\nthe government\\'s only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\\nSpence attacked Cooper\\'s credibility by pointing out discrepancies\\nbetween Cooper\\'s statements last September and those made in court.\\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\\na few seconds...It\\'s difficult to remember what went on first.\"\\n\\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver\\'s dog.\\n\\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan\\'s\\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\\n\\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\\nhad Cooper discussed last August\\'s events, Cooper responded, \"If\\nyou\\'re implying that we got our story together, you\\'re wrong,\\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense\\'s version of\\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\\nkilling the Weaver\\'s dog.  Cooper disagreed.\\n\\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence\\'s\\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \\nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\\ndefense\\'s version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I\\'m not going to play games with either\\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\\nacting like professionals.\"\\n\\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we\\'ll see\\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \\nSpence continued, \"We\\'re going to find...that there is a very unlikely\\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\\n\\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen\\'s repeated\\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can\\'t have a fair trial if the\\njury believes I\\'m some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I\\'m\\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I\\'m\\nviolating court orders.\"\\n\\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen\\'s\\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\\nhis comments when objecting.\\n\\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\\nRampton.  The prosecution\\'s purpose was simply to introduce five\\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\\non the opportunity to further address Cooper\\'s credibility.\\n\\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris\\' other attorney) questioned\\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\\nplans to kill the Weaver\\'s dog without being detected.  Matthews then\\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"',\n",

I assume it would come with memory ordered from\\nthem, so I guess I should be glad they didn\\'t just say \"Buy the memory\\nfrom us\" or something like that.)\\n\\n\\tThe one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a\\n1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or\\nenlarged desktop mode.

I\\nasked them why, and all I got was \"Your point is well taken, but\\nOrchid\\'s software developers are busy with other projects.\"\\n\\n\\tSo, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805\\ndrivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?

What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith\\n(i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced\\nof the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal\\nrevelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those\\nbeliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to\\naccepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the\\nconflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs\\narise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God \\nmust reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would \\nhonestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone \\nwho disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are \\nrejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient \\nfor them, or because they wish to spurn God.\\n\\nI would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one \\nholds are universal and absolute.

In view of the\\nrumors circulating it is expected that an inquiry will be instigated.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t- - - Reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _New York Times_, December 23, 1924, page 3, column 2 (bottom)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t- - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\nOn the 78th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians,\\nwe remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an \\nemerging Turkish proto-fascist state. In their names we demand justice.\\n\\nIn April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed \\nde-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a \\ngenocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively\\nruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The \\nresult: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen\\nand plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization\\non those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any\\nvestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today\\'s Turkish\\ngovernmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture\\ndistortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In \\nthe face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies \\nshamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy \\nmerely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state \\npolicy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a \\ncrime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the \\nsuccessful genocide of the Armenians.\\n\\nTurkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...\\nArmenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of \\nTurkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as \\n\"rebels\".\\n\\nTurkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population\\nfigures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.\\n\\nTurkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims \\nArmenians were a \"threat\".\\n\\nIn a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of \\napproximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.\\n\\nToday, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The\\nsuccess of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey\\'s Kurdish\\npopulation.\\n\\nThe Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and\\nproperty lost as a result of this genocide.\\n\\nARMENIANS DEMAND JUSTICE                              ERMENILER ADALET ISTIYOR\\n\\n',\n",

An awful lot of the\\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\\nwe encouraged them to take out.

All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn\\'t give a shit.  And that goes for the\\nsupposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\nWell put, Jim.  I am as concerned about the media\\'s complicity in this\\ngrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the\\ninvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from\\nany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been\\nbehind it.  What\\'s going on here?\\n\\nLet\\'s look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.\\nI\\'m a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops\\nbecause I\\'ve found some of the techniques to be useful in business\\nnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR\\nknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a\\npsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had\\nprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh\\'s behavior was\\nemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from\\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their\\nisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh\\'s religious\\norientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as\\nthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being\\nconsumed in the apocalypse.\\n\\nIMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated\\npsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of\\naction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly\\nappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the\\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\\nobstensibly to perform \"gas insertions\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\\nhim over the edge.\\n\\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh\\'s attorney mentioned on TV\\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh\\'s major concern was the biblical\\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\\n\"gas insertion\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\\n\\nLet\\'s step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\\n\\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\\ncompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the\\nFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the\\nrevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without\\nall that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to\\nshow the world how big her balls are.\\n\\nYesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.

       " 'This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two\\nnew newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing\\nthe one originally posted in January \\'93 (and never taken to a vote).  The\\nproposed groups are described below:\\n\\nNAME: \\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup\\nSTATUS:  Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about\\n\\t system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.\\n\\nNAME:\\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc\\nSTATUS:\\t Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,\\n\\t including issues such as security, networking features, console\\n\\t mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.\\n\\nRATIONALE:\\n\\tMicrosoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family\\n\\tof operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish\\n\\tto argue about the meaning of an \"OS\").  The family ranges from\\n\\tModular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to\\n\\tWindows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over\\n\\t50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the\\n\\tactual release is slated for May/June \\'93.\\n\\n\\tWhile Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares\\n\\tan application programming interface with the other members of the\\n\\tWindows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-\\n\\tdows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking\\n\\tand security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for\\n\\tWindows 3.1.\\n\\n\\tThe user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows\\n\\t3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses\\n\\tProgram Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-\\n\\tsents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced\\n\\tWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and\\n\\tNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.\\n\\n\\tThus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following\\n\\tgroups with the other members of the Windows family:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.apps\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32\\n\\t\\n\\tThe following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as\\n\\twell as Windows 3.1:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.announce\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.advocacy\\n\\t\\n\\tIn conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the\\n\\tWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal\\n\\tstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating\\n\\tsystems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have\\n\\tundergone major rewrites without having been split into separate\\n\\tnewsgroup hierarchies.\\n\\n\\tFurther, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --\\n\\twhen the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-\\n\\tgeneration Windows, \"Chicago\", debuts next year, surely it should\\n\\tremain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-\\n\\ttification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?\\n\\n\\nDISCUSSION PERIOD:\\n\\tThe discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  \\n\\nVOTING:\\n\\tThe CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on\\n\\tthe feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will\\n\\tbe accepted prior to the CFV.',\n",

The Cryptography \\nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \\nevery 21 days.\\n\\n\\nContents:\\n\\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\\n* What are the US export regulations?\\n* What is TEMPEST?\\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\\n* Is RSA patented?\\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\\n\\n\\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\\n\\n  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It\\n  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and\\n  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is\\n  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,\\n  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the\\n  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of\\n  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many\\n  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break\\n  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national\\n  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.\\n\\n  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of\\n  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the\\n  difference between public and private research in cryptography:\\n\\n  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,\\n  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted\\n  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged\\n  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of\\n  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10\\n  years has there in fact been widespread open research in\\n  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts\\n  between these two research communities. Open research is common\\n  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open\\n  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in\\n  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with\\n  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,\\n  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can\\n  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might\\n  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?\\n  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would\\n  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one\\n  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with\\n  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most\\n  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have\\n  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in\\n  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which\\n  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''\\n\\n* What are the US export regulations?\\n\\n  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control\\n  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export\\n  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by\\n  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office\\n  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized\\n  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule\\n  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent\\n  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see\\n  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.\\n\\n  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting\\n  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what\\n  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which\\n  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to\\n  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in\\n  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at\\n  least heard of the ITAR.\\n\\n* What is TEMPEST?\\n\\n  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer\\n  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that\\n  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at\\n  quite a distance and with little effort.\\n\\n  Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext\\n  is available this way.\\n\\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\\n\\n  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for\\n  corrections.)\\n\\n  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas\\n  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass\\n  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving\\n  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the\\n  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.\\n  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;\\n  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the\\n  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;\\n  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.\\n\\n  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various\\n  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:\\n\\n  The Beale Cypher Association\\n  P.O. Box 975\\n  Beaver Falls, PA 15010\\n\\n  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the\\n  line:\\n\\n  send index\\n\\n  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.\\n  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher\\n  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,\\n  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)\\n\\n  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of\\n  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI\\n  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.\\n  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this\\n  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an\\n  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this\\n  string.\\n\\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\\n\\n  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis\\n  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with\\n  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes\\n  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in\\n  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,\\n  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.\\n\\n  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;\\n  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent\\n  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.\\n\\n* Is RSA patented?\\n\\n  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.\\n  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been\\n  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral\\n  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information\\n  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of\\n  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as\\n  ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other\\n  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.\\n\\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\\n\\n  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the\\n  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list\\n  is: <voynich-request@rand.org>\\n\\n  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich\",\n",

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew\\'s main\\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\\nwill take particular claims at face value.\\n\\nImmanuel:\\n\\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\\n\\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\\n       Joseph, will name him \\'Jesus\\' (which means G\\'d is\\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\\n       spoken by a prophet:\\n\\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\\n       lord G\\'d said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \\n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G\\'d your lord.  It\\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\\n       Ahaz said, \"I won\\'t ask; I will not put the lord to a\\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G\\'d is with us.\"   He will\\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\\n       you dread will have been deserted...\\n\\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \\nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\\nlater Christians to be G\\'d walking among men, was never called by\\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\\n\\nEgypt:\\n\\n       After Jesus\\'s birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\\n\\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\\n\\n\\nWhat the lord really said was this.\\n\\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \\n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba\\'als, and kept burning\\n       incense to idols.\\n\\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea\\'s oracle.  But, it\\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G\\'d.   Again, this prophecy\\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\\n\\nRachel Weeps:\\n\\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\\n\\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\\n       no more.\"   \\n\\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \\nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus\\'s life to enhance\\nthe message of the church\\'s gospel.\\n       Because of the whole story\\'s similarity to the tale of the\\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G\\'d\\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\\nwould not suit Matthew\\'s purpose, as the children he speaks of are\\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\\nconvincing.\\n\\nThe Nazarene:\\n\\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \\n\\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\\n\\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \\nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson\\'s mother that\\nshe will,\\n\\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\\n\\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G\\'d. \\nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\\nsimple making them up now.\\n\\nBearing our\\nDiseases:\\n\\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\\nand disabilities.\\n\\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\\n       diseases.\"\\n\\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\\n\\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\\n\\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\\nof Israel, Jehovah\\'s chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\\ninstrument of the nations\\' salvation by G\\'d.\\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew\\'s parallel\\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\\n\\n\\nSilent Messiah:\\n\\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn\\'t arouse\\nthe attention of the local rulers.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \\n\\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\\n       name.\"\\n\\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\\n\\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\\n       await his law.\\n\\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\\nG\\'d there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\\nbe the children of G\\'d.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew\\'s attempt at\\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\\n\\nThree Days and\\nThree Nights:\\n\\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\\nresurrection.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\\n       three nights.\\n\\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \\n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn\\'t forget that\\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\\n\\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew\\'s little\\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\\ngod\\'s mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\\n\\nHearing &\\nUnderstanding:\\n\\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\\n\\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \\n\\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\\n       people\\'s heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\\n       them.\"\\n\\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \\nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G\\'d,\\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\\n\\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G\\'d said, \"Go, and say to this\\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\\n       see, but do not perceive.\\'   Make the heart of this\\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G\\'ds take men far\\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\\n       stump.\\n\\nHere we see that it is really G\\'d who causes the people of Israel\\nto stop listening to the prophet\\'s warnings, but reaffirms the\\npromise made to Solomon\\'s (and David\\'s) seed/lineage.  If you read\\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\\nof G\\'d to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\\nof Isaiah\\'s verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn\\'t\\nunderstand Jesus\\'s stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah\\'s verses are\\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G\\'d to him, in the\\npresent.   Once again, Matthew\\'s prophecy falls flat on its face. \\n\\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus\\'s parables look like they\\nhave the prophetic approval.\\n\\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\\n       foundation of the world.\"\\n\\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \\n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\\n       lord...\\n\\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\\nof Matthew\\'s gospel even inserted Isaiah\\'s name as this prophet. \\nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\\nof it up.\\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \\nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \\nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\\nMatthew\\'s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew\\'s prophecies aren\\'t the\\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\\n\\n\\nExcuses of\\nLittle Faith:\\n\\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\\nthey didn\\'t have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\\nwoman\\'s arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\\n\\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \\n\\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don\\'t get to see\\nGod anymore.\\n\\n       We\\'re too lazy; we\\'re not zealous enough; we\\'re\\n       sinful; it\\'s just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\\n       own demands on G\\'d\\'s appearance; if we had the right\\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G\\'d on his terms...\\n\\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G\\'d.  You, dear\\nreader, have not seen G\\'d.  Not literally, you know that to be\\ntrue. (I know that\\'s presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we\\'ve seen religions do is\\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G\\'d.  They say\\nour little faith does not merit us to see G\\'d.  Sometimes, they\\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\\nlives of people change... that is seeing G\\'d.\"   Thus people get\\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G\\'d into the everyday\\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G\\'d as I am speaking of... it is\\nnot seeing G\\'d the way people used to see.  \\n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\\nhas little faith.\\n\\x0c\\nJesus Rides on\\nan Ass:\\n\\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\\nJerusalem.  \\n\\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\\n       by the prophet, saying,\\n\\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\\n       ass-colt.\"\\n\\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\\ndifferently.\\n\\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew\\'s version, we get a\\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\\n\\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\\n\\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven\\'t you read?  `Out of the mouth of\\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.\\'\\n\\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\\nfit Matthew\\'s track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\\nMatthew, \"Haven\\'t you read?\" for the source reads,\\n\\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\\n       enemy and the avenger.\\n\\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G\\'d,\\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\\njust one more case of Matthew\\'s pen making up convenient prophetic\\nscripture.\\n\\nYHVH said to \\nmy lord...:\\n\\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\\n\\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\\n\\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\\nnature of the messiah-king.  It\\'s tempting to believe this, if one\\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \\nBut, there are problems.\\n       In Jesus\\'s time, the psalm was thought to be about the\\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David\\'s\\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus\\'s time had\\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\\nhis audience, who thought the messiah\\'s advent was imminent, and\\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\\n\\n       YHVH\\'s utterance to my lord:\\n\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\\n       footstool.\"\\n\\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\\n       holy mountains.  \\n\\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\\n       forever.\"\\n\\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G\\'d.  It is merely an\\naddress of respect.  \\n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\\npoet, about David\\'s covenant and endorsement from G\\'d.  If the\\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\\nfrom David, was not present in David\\'s age.  We have extensive\\ntales of David\\'s doings and sayings-- none of which include any\\npraises of a messiah.\\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G\\'d had put his show of\\nfavour for David\\'s kingdom on hold.  \\n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\\npromised by G\\'d a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \\nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus\\'s question.  As we\\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\\n\\nMoses & Jesus,\\nHad it Together\\nAll Along...:\\n\\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\\npseudo-prophecy in John\\'s gospel.  The gospel story of John\\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\\nfrom the real events of Jesus\\'s career as told by even Matthew. \\nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\\nby G\\'d.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\\n\\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\\n\\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \\nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\\nwhich corresponds to John\\'s little prophecy.  It is par for the\\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\\nstill cling to it.\\n\\nThe Potter\\'s\\nField:\\n\\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn\\'t lawful for\\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter\\'s field with it to\\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\\n\\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter\\'s\\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\\n\\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\\nMatthew makes use of.\\n\\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\\n       YHVH.\\n\\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\\nof the messiah, or of G\\'d.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\\nshortly before G\\'d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\\nMatthew\\'s quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah\\'s context, whereas \"potter\\'s\\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\\nMatthew\\'s track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\\nintentional dishonesty.\\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas\\'s situation, and if\\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew\\'s work is convincing\\nenough.\\n\\nWine, Vinegar,\\n& Casting Lots:\\n\\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\\n\\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\\n\\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\\n\\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\\n\\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\\n\\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\\n       Book of the Living.\\n\\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\\npsalm asks G\\'d for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\\nJesus of the gospels says,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\\n       don\\'t know what they do!\"\\n\\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus\\'s drink, not his\\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\\n\\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\\nsay that the fact that Jesus\\'s clothes were divided as told is no\\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\\nJesus\\'s clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\\nsuspicions.\\n\\nThe 22nd Psalm:\\n\\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\\nwill examine the primary passages.\\n\\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \\n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\\n       don\\'t answer, and by night, but find no rest.\\n\\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \\nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn\\'t do much\\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\\nboth day and night on the cross.\\n\\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \\n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\\n\\nThis seems to fit Jesus\\'s execution pretty well, with the\\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\\n\\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\\n\\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\\n\\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\\n\\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I\\'m sure the early Christian\\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\\n\\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\\n       hands and feet...\\n\\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka\\'ari),\\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka\\'aru.\"   But, to\\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\\ntranslators.\\n\\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\\npsalm\\'s true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\\nthe forearms.  This doesn\\'t say much in favour of the traditional\\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren\\'t bound by our religious beliefs.\\n\\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\\ninterpretations of Jesus\\'s life and death.  How much these\\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\\nthings for St. Matthew.\\n\\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus\\'s\\ncrucifixion.  John\\'s gospel recount, written about 70 years after\\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus\\'s execution,\\n\\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\\n       \"The will look on him whom they\\'ve pierced.\"\\n\\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\\nthem.\\n\\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\\n\\nJohn\\'s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\\nMatthew\\'s attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\\nthan just one passage.  John\\'s errors are grossly obvious and\\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\\nreligion were founded.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nReckoned with\\nTransgressors:\\n\\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\\n\\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\\n\\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\\n\\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\\n\\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\\n       with him railed, \"Aren\\'t you the messiah?! Save\\n       yourself, and us!\"\\n\\nThis certainly fits with Mark\\'s recount, which tells how the\\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\\n\\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\\n       \"Don\\'t you fear G\\'d, since you are under the same\\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \\n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \\n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\\n\\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\\napparently noble and of principle, doesn\\'t seem likely to have\\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\\nLuke.  Of course, Luke\\'s recount also disagrees with Mark\\'s.  \\nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\\nwords of G\\'d do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\\nseen.\\n\\nThe End of the\\nWorld--\\n       Mt. 24:\\n\\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\\nwhich he has been warning about.\\n\\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple\\'s\\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\\n\\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \\n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\\n       the mountains.\\n\\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\\n       pass away until all these things take place...\\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\\n       at an hour you do not expect.\\n\\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\\nthem that although he doesn\\'t know the exact day or hour, that it\\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \\nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\\nswept away.\\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \\nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\\nhe didn\\'t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \\nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\\nat the Apostles\\' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\\n\\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \\nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\\njust the right moment to spring?\\n\\n\\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn\\'t in the best\\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \\nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \\nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\\nChristianity can securely keep hold.',\n",

A genocide of Armenians took place\\nduring peacetime.\\n\\nAnd it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in\\nthose days. He was still young. Born in 1926.\\n\\nOn that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there \\nwas unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we \\ndidn\\'t think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they\\nwouldn\\'t go into people\\'s apartments. About five o\\'clock we saw a large crowd \\nnear the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home \\nwatching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir \\nStreet. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our \\nhouse is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields\\nthere. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the \\ndirection of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and \\nstarted shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off \\nthe light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the\\nlight. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn\\'t know \\nand thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.\\n\\nSuddenly there\\'s pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:\\nthere were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother\\nAleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War \\nII and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.\\n\\nWe went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down \\nwith axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, \"What\\'s going on? What\\'s \\nhappened?\" They say, \"Armenians, get out of here!\" We don\\'t open the door, we \\nsay, \"If we have to leave, we\\'ll leave, we\\'ll leave tomorrow.\" They say, \"No, \\nleave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!\" By now they\\'ve \\nbroken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best\\nwe can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. \\nWe had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,\\nand grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and\\nwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no\\npolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We \\nheld the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an \\naxe, and then with a crowbar.\\n\\nWhen the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them \\nwith the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, \\npipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father \\nin the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the\\nroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother\\nSasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he\\nwas the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured \\nseveral of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But \\nthey, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there\\nwere many of them.\\n\\nThe door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go \\ninto the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought \\nskewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father \\nbleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, \\nand his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw \\nthat. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove\\nthem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the \\nbandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in \\nthere, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to \\nchase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of \\nabout 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and\\nMother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and \\nstarted calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through\\nthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no \\none came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader \\nof the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a \\nfur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: \"What\\'s with you, \\nwoman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?\"\\nShe says, \"What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!\" My father \\nwas a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian \\nand Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, \\n\"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he \\nbrought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\" He says, \"You \\ndon\\'t need to shout, stop shouting.\" And when they heard the voice of this \\nman, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and \\nstarted running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, \\ntoo. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don\\'t \\nknow if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even\\nthough we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started \\nto massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to \\ncall an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all \\nevening and all through the night.\\n\\nSomewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were \\nfrom Khachmas. They said, \"We heard that a group was here at your place, you \\nhave our condolences.\" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay\\nin the room.\\n\\nSo we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,\\nwe say, if they descend on us again we\\'ll defend ourselves. Somewhere around \\none o\\'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, \\ninvestigators. They say, \"Leave everything just how it is, we\\'re coming back \\nhere soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\"\\nThen people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take \\nFather away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take \\nFather away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,\\nbut no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the \\nneighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should \\nhide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and \\nwent up to the neighbor\\'s.\\n\\nThe excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,\\nZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a \\nlanding force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A\\ncrowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings\\n19 and 20, that\\'s next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking \\ninto Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians \\nweren\\'t at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they \\npoured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were \\nsome Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \"They\\'re up there, still,\\nup there. Let\\'s go kill them!\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in \\nthe two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding \\none floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door \\nshouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling \\nthe corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, \\nand the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, \"No, that\\'s from some of the \\nfurniture.\" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed \\nhim down.\\n\\nThe mob left somewhere around eight o\\'clock. They smashed open the door and \\nwent into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also\\nArmenians, they had left for another city.\\n\\nThe father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \"Are you \\ncrazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don\\'t you now they\\'re checking all the \\napartments? They could kill you and them!\" And to us :\" . . . Come on, leave \\nthis apartment!\" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors\\'. At\\nfirst the man didn\\'t want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and\\nhe relented. We stayed there until eleven o\\'clock at night. We heard the sound\\nof motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went \\ndownstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the \\nother rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. \\nThey left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal \\nthey had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our\\nMicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.\\n\\nWith the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were \\nsaved. Our salvation--my mother\\'s, my brother\\'s, and mine,--was purely \\naccidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the \\ncrowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only\\nable to save Mother. We couldn\\'t save Father. We inflicted many injuries on \\nthe bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We \\nwere also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our\\nshare. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the \\ntroops. And if troops hadn\\'t come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been \\neven greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the \\ngenocide.\\n\\nThrough an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the \\nleadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their \\norders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to \\'\\npick up Father\\'s corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o\\'clock \\nin the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was \\nquite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried \\nFather into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were \\nabout six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It \\nwas gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people \\nthere, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being\\ntaken to Baku. There was a woman\\'s corpse there too, she had been . . . well, \\nthere was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman\\'s body. It \\nwas something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The \\nchild that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible\\nto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a \\nman there, too, several men. You couldn\\'t tell anything because their faces \\nwere disfigured, they were in such awful condition...\\n\\nNow two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what \\nhappened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my \\nfather, and how we fought, and the people\\'s sorrow, and especially the morgue.\\n\\nI still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was\\nestablished, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what \\nhappened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.\\n\\nI\\'m particularly surprised that the mob wasn\\'t even afraid of the troops. They\\neven fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel \\nmixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They \\nweren\\'t afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our \\ntroops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right\\nacross from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The \\ninhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the \\nsoldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They \\nweren\\'t afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were \\nat the neighbors\\' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket \\noffice I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing \\nArmenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that \\nthey were being burned. During those days no one from the police department \\ncame to anyone\\'s aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though\\nperhaps they could have come and saved us.\\n\\nAs we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus \\nstation. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in \\nfighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in \\nwhich buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had\\nlists, the bandits. You can tell that the \"operation\" was  planned in advance.\\n\\nThanks, of course, to our troops, to the country\\'s leadership, and to the\\nleadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian\\npeople, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops \\nsuffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my \\nfamily and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait\\nArmenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would\\nhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.\\n\\nAt present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR\\nProcuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest\\npossible punishment, because if they don\\'t, the tragedy, the genocide, could \\nhappen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted\\nout for such deeds.\\n\\nVery many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass \\ndisturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,\\nvery few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There \\nwere around 80 people near our building alone, that\\'s how many people took \\npart in the pogrom of our building all in all.\\n\\nThey should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that \\nretribution awaits those who perform such acts.\\n\\n   May 18, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

The concept is called \"context\", and you should really become\\nfamiliar with it someday.\\n\\n\\nUnless this transaltes to \"Clemens hasn\\'t gone into Lou Gorman\\'s office with\\na large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he\\'d been traded to\\nthe Jays,\" I\\'m at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.\\n\\n\\nWhat on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has \"won\" 68% of\\nthe games he\\'s started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17\\nwins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing\\nthe other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If\\nso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris\\nallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in\\nhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens\\' career ERA. But\\nI forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance\\nto Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it\\nwould have been a routine groundout, right?\\n\\n\\nSpeaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to\\nyou many times that attributing greatness to players based on the\\naccomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that\\na racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your\\ncontinued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to\\nany of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have\\nspent a few too many games in goal without a mask.\\n\\n\\nNo one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win\\nat least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the\\nWorld Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they\\nkeep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they\\ntraded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link\\nbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man\\nwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs\\nout, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,\\ngave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.\\n\\nSeriously, Roger, I\\'d really like to hear your explanation of the difference\\nbetween the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,\\nand why? Did Morris somehow \"learn how to win\" in the intervening ten years?\\nIf so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half\\na run lower than 1992?\\n\\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com',\n",

Armenians were involved in \\nespionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and \\nArabian Peninsula.

       " '\\nThe Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that\\n\"the people\" is a term of art refering to an individual right, and\\nhave explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.\\n\\nI quote:\\n\\n  \"... \\'the people\\' seems to have been a term of art employed in\\n  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the\\n  Constitution is ordained, and established by \\'the people of the\\n  the U.S.\\'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people\\n  to keep and bear Arms ....\"\\n\\t- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).\\n\\nFurthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution\\nfor possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not\\npresented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the\\ngovernment that such weapons have no military value -- they held that\\nthe amendment protected the individual right to possess military\\nweapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully\\ngotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the\\ninterpretation.\\n\\nFurthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:\\n\\n \"The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,\\n  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the\\n  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major\\n  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-\\n  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right\\n  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.\"\\n   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the\\n     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,\\n     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )\\n\\nYou might rightfully ask \"well then, what does that first bit about\\nmilitias mean?\"\\n\\nWell, \"militia\" in historical context basically means the whole of the\\nadult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines\\n\"militia\" as all armed men over the age of 17).\\n\\n   \"The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting\\n    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were\\n    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of\\n    the kind in common use at the time.\"\\n\\t- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).\\n\\nThe reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale\\nbehind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to\\nbear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military\\npower could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the\\ngovernment would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than\\nthe other way around.\\n\\n   \"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason\\n   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last\\n   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\"\\n     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776\\n       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C.

Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be\\n   refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\"\\n     - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in\\n       Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).\\n\\n   \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;\\n   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.

       " 'Mr DeCenso, in spite of requiring Scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas,\\nrejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases\\nthose scholars opinion on the subject:\\n\\n\\nand \\n\\n\\nActually, if you do further research as to the Greek word \"apacgw,\" you will\\nfind that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent\\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I\\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nA couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit \\nand stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" A\\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is\\n\"strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\\nreferences though, \"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New\\nTestament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\\nfurther context).  \\n\\nThe word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and\\nthe root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words is included in\\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\\ngreek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a\\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\\nspecifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\"\\nIn literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out\\nof the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it\\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\\nstate that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one\\'s life by hanging.\" He then\\nnotes the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\\npresents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by\\nhanging.\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by\\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is\\ndenoted as the result). \\n\\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":\\n\\n\\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\\nHebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \\nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the\\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from\\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\\n\"apacgw\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \\n\\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\\nhistorical source to justify it. \\n\\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose\\'s statement about trees around the Potter\\'s Field:\\n\\n\\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \\n\\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\\nas the 30 silvers:\\n\\n\\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas\\' betrayal\\n\"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas\\'\\nactions \"an iniquity\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\\n\\n    \"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\\n     him \"Buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something\\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\\n     it was night.\"\\n\\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \\n\\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\\nevidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas\\' hanging was\\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\\nthat night as well, and thus couldn\\'t have spent that either.  Oh dear, I\\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \\n\\nMaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on\\nFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.\\n\\nBy the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter\\'s field came from (ie: the\\nmention of it in Matthew), you say:\\n\\n\\nI am reminding you now to discuss it now. It\\'s all part of the same verse we\\nare discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping \\nthese issues.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n\\tA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid Hume, Philosopher\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding',\n",

However, who is at blame is another question.\\nIt seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions--\\nrealizing the risks--is to blame.\\n\\n\\nYes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing\\nany raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally\\nfrom the rest of society because of this.\\n\\n\\nAnd I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent\\nperson will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact,\\nmany criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment\\nof innocents.\\n\\n\\nBut, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals\\non the road.  Again, the blame is on society.\\n\\n\\nYes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do\\nso much to prevent false witnesses.\\n\\n\\nOkay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not\\nall such \"murders\" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life\\nis wrong, no matter what the circumstances?\\n\\n\\nBut, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an\\ninnocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of\\nsociety shares this blame.

Executions do not, because by allowing\\nit at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the\\ninnocent victim is.\\n\\n\\nReading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction\\nwas moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth\\nmatters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That\\nis, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.\\n\\n\\nBut then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the\\nconviction was unfair.\\n\\n\\nYes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all\\npossible information), we can\\'t always determine the difference in our\\nflawed system.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\ndetermnined.\\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\nacquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\nan event can have value. \\nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\nI didn\\'t make these rules, it\\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\netc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\\nweight whatsoever.',\n",
       "  '\\n[ -and many others mailed me.  Here is a reply to one of the letters.  Seems to\\nme that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell!]\\n\\n\\n\\nYour using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course,\\nin your termonology, God could not \"cease to exist.\"  However, that is not what\\ndeath ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see\\nthat it signifies \"separation.\"  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is\\nthe reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one\\nmember of the Godhead was separated from the other two.  \\n\\nI once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived. \\nShe was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my\\n\"girlfriend\" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were\\nseparated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided\\nthat she couldn\\'t wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was\\ndeath.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is\\nseparation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not\\nbecause He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go\\nthere.  \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in\\nthat until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He\\nwas trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued\\non my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and\\nunloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us\\ndo as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh. \\nYou have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to\\nyou that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.  \\n\\n\\nThis may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct\\nknowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.\\n Jesus most certainly felt the \"pinpricks\" of life.  As the Scripture say:\\n\\nHeb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our\\nweaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without\\nsin.\\n\\nThe kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes\\nwhen He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine\\nto think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  \"The Consciousness of\\nChrist.\"  I have talked at length with a great many people about this\\ninteresting study, including clh.  \\n\\nIt is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually\\nsuffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we\\ndo.  He \"grew in knowledge.\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose\\nto be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \"led of the Spirit\" to such\\nan extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and\\nJesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him,\\nthe tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise. \\nThat is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was\\nliving sequential history as you or I.  \\n\\nMaybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion\\nand one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than\\nnot.\\n\\n\\nI was once a member of that club.  THe \"free thinker\" is a glorious ideal.  By\\ncontrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository\\nof everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find\\nsuch a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist\\nwishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right. \\nBut what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \"rational\\ndoubt\" when in fact he was led to it by his \"faith\".  He must acknowledge that\\nwhile it is rational doubt for him as a \"free thinker\" to criticize the\\nChristian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize\\nhim as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no\\nfaith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.\\n\\nPascal pointed out that \"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.\\n Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\"  The fact that skeptics are not\\nskeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must\\nbelieve in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or\\neven most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a\\nmeasure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define\\nhimself only in negative terms, hence the term \"a\"-theist.\\n\\nSome people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In\\nmy campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember. \\nHowever, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word,\\nevery point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication\\nspeaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make\\nsense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.\\n\\nThat is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism\\nis arbitrary.  Next time you\\'re in a room of skeptics, yell out \"Look, your fly\\nis undone!\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he\\nbelieves without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it\\nunderlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he\\nknows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity. \\nThe answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on\\npresuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before\\nit is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and\\ncritical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective\\nand neutral.  In other words, another myth.  \\n\\nPresuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is\\nsomething we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can\\nbe criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are\\nour silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for\\nabsence.\\n\\n\\nOf course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had\\nbeen in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \"Highlander\" movie. \\nBut again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of\\nGod.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic\\ntheology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His\\nprophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you\\nare to reject God\\'s annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct\\nunderstanding of Himself.',\n",

So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from\\nLeviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be\\nignored by Christians (haven\\'t seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).\\n\\nLater,\\nMax (Bob) Muir\\n\\n[The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly\\ncited passages are:\\n\\nthe story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and\\nthere\\'s no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate\\nposition on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the\\nBible for its sinfulness.  It doesn\\'t seem to have been known\\nspecifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a\\ncesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes,\\nhomosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action\\ndescribed.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about\\nas many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of\\nguests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically\\nabout homosexuality.\\n\\nIn the NT, the clear references are all from Paul\\'s letters.  In Rom\\n1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil.\\nNote that the passage isn\\'t about homosexuality -- it\\'s about\\nidolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at\\nleast result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this\\npassage.  It does not use the word \"homosexuality\", and it is referring\\nto people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality.\\nSo it\\'s not what I\\'d call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.\\nBut it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway,\\nthat Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards \\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nThe other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim\\n1:10.  Unfortunately it\\'s not entirely clear what the words used here\\nmean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning,\\nsuch as \"wanton\", and that another may be specifically \"male\\nprostitute\".  Again, we don\\'t have here a precise teaching about\\nhomosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul\\nshared the OT\\'s negative judgement on homosexuality.\\n\\nJude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it\\'s probably not relevant.  The\\ncontext in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in\\nSodom were angels, it seems likely that \"strange flesh\" refers to\\nintercourse with angels.\\n\\nAs you can see, the NT evidence is such that people\\'s conclusion is\\ndetermined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that\\nthe passages from Paul\\'s letters imply that he accepted the OT\\nprohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT\\nendorsement.  Liberals note that there\\'s no specific teaching, and no\\nclear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in\\nRom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly\\ndo the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is\\nlegitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his\\nbackground and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.\\n\\nThis is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long\\ndissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it\\'s\\nclear to me that that\\'s mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down\\nto is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they\\nbelieve that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This\\nappears to depend upon one\\'s reaction to the message of the Bible as a\\nwhole, as well as one\\'s perception of the needs of the church today.\\nThis is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference\\nbetween Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both\\nsides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they\\nkeep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the\\nother side will finally come to their senses.

       "  'I\\'ve been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington, \\nI think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of \\netymology.  I\\'ve been reflecting on what certain words meant in my \\nchildhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. \\n\\nI grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very \\nangry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It \\ncarried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some \\ntime to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ\\' and \\n`Christian\\'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To \\nbecome a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would \\nconsider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared \\nto pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a \\nbetter bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable \\nriches of knowing Christ.\\n\\nAs it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that \\nthey were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time \\nthey had decided it wasn\\'t a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They \\ndidn\\'t disown me but they didn\\'t completely accept the situation either.  \\nFor example, they didn\\'t come to my wedding because it was in a church.   \\nWhen I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her \\ndeath, she said to me, \"As far as I\\'m concerned, you still are a Jew.\" \\nWhat she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a \\nJew.  I am a Christian.  (I\\'ll concede, one that likes chicken soup with \\nmatzoh balls.:-)) \\n\\nI do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My \\nsons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who \\ndo consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people \\nJews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.\\n\\nThis is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their \\nexperience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while \\nfollowing Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  \\n\\nI am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  \\nIt was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have \\na sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small \\nsacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it \\nand do not want to ask for it back.\\n\\nAnd while I don\\'t have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  \\nI am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the \\nChurch.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is \\nthat it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, \\nbeing rooted in the past. \\n\\nThis is probably one of the reasons why I don\\'t like it when people mess \\naround with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of \\nEaster).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.\\n\\nI suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn\\'t assume that all \\nbelievers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish \\nChristian\\' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. ',\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs far as I can see, one of the big differences between Davidians and\\nChristians is in who they follow.  I have sometimes tried to put myself\\nin the feet of one of Jesus's disciples.  Basically, they gave up a\\nlot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow\\nJesus.\\n\\nSo what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and\\nDavid Koresh was not.\\n\\nThe problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good\\nand what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of \\nlaws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard\\nto bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find\\na legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just,\\nthen we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice\\nwould be followed.  But since judges don't always get it right,\\nwe have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches\\nof other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice\\nof man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice\\nsystem in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.\\n\\nThere is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation\\nmore than the material being presented.  So we might consider \\na ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another\\nreligion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire\\nto protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows\\npeople to do bad things. \\n\\nI think that it is the message that is important.

I guess that what I am trying to\\nsay is that we shouldn't be looking for principles that tell us\\nwhy the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and\\nworship a person.

       "  \"\\n\\tI originally wrote to the person who asked this question\\npersonally, but decided to post the information I had on the topic.\\n\\n\\tI spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently, \\nby coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that \\nwhile it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence\\nof a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the \\nChurch as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church \\nrecoginizes itself as a community of believers, members\\nof the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable\\nto each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical\\ncouple on the desert island, there are many places in the\\nworld that do not have priests availible for marriages\\non a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without\\nthe priest being present, but get the priest to testify to\\ntheir marriage when one comes through the area.  \\n\\n\\tI remember a religion teacher in high school saying\\nthat the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple\\nas much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus,\\nmarried couples have some responsibility to the community\\nto stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the\\ncommunity.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with\\none another--the community should be able to rely on that \\ncouple to be as one.\\n\\n\\tWhile couples may marry without witnesses, they \\nmay NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An \\nanulment is simply an admission of the church that what\\nthey had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage\\nat all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married\\nin the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves\\nanulments a half-hour later!!\\n\\n\\tI tend to agree with the response back there that\\nsaid couples become married as soon as they consumate their\\nmarriage, but I would add that couples should consider their\\nmarriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they\\nintended to be married, assuming they were both willing\\npartners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared\\nto raise any children they may have as a result of that\\nsexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a\\ncommitment, I believe, in God's eyes.\\n\\n\\tBut I'm digressing....\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tGod be with you,\",\n",

Now the\\nproto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and \"the\\nwoman\", and enmity between Satan and \"her seed.\"  Now the woman is both\\nEve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. \\n\"Her seed\" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the\\nsame way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as\\nwe do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that\\nMary is also sinless because if she wasn\\'t she would 1) not be at enmity\\nwith the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her\\nsinlessness to Christ\\'s sinlessness would be called into question, as\\nwould God\\'s veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the\\nserpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.\\n    Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the\\nArchangle Gabriel \"full of grace.\"  As I pointed out above this is from\\nthe Greek word \"Kecharitomene\" which means not just full of grace, but a\\nplenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by\\nthe footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, \"Hail you who have been and reamin\\nfilled with grace.\"  But that is a little to long to say, so it is\\nreduced to full of grace.  And as it says, \"you who have been\" Mary had\\nalways been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which\\nwas also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.\\n    It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done\\nwhat the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if\\nGod could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his\\nMother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the\\nFathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo\\n, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of\\nChristian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on\\nthe matter in \"Ineffibilus Deus.\"',\n",

The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\\n4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only\\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\\n\\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\\n\"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is\\nbased on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\\nGod promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their\\nhearts\" (Heb. 8:10).\\n\\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\\n\\n4.  Israel stands for God\\'s people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\\ninto Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of\\nIsrael\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ\\'s, then are ye\\nAbraham\\'s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are\\nAbraham\\'s seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\\n\\n\\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\\nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I\\nam now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through\\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is\\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).\\n\\n\\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\"\\nwith \"go to a worship service.\"\\n\\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\\nday of the moral law.\\nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\\nmake false gods, to violate God\\'s name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\\n\\nDarius\\n\\n[It\\'s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.

I just wish he might equally\\naccept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing\\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\\n\\nHowever I\\'d like to be clear that I do not think there\\'s unambiguous\\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\\n\\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they\\ngathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of\\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \\n\\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn\\'t tell us\\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius\\'\\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn\\'t say they gathered to\\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that\\'s just not explicit\\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul\\'s\\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can\\'t disprove it,\\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\\nof every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \\n\\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\\nworship was.',\n",

If there is any Scripture from\\nwhich we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the\\nsabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.\\n\\nIf one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \"the sabbath cannot\\nbe a ceremonial law\" then he will have to find some way around it, like\\nsaying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the\\n7tH day, Because \"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\"  But\\nPaul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal \\nstatement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin\\nin his writings.\\n\\nAlso, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which\\ntalks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have\\nbeen a big problem for first century Christians living in a society\\nthat did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were\\nslaves.

On what basis? Are we extra-biblical at this\\npoint? Why not also acknowledge that the Bhagavad-Gita is the only\\nrelevant text for Gentiles, after all we see in the Bible that it was\\nMagus from the east who observed the star-signs of Jesus?

Who\\nsays that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments?\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re implying that Jesus\\' words are valid only for Jews. Is this\\nreally what you mean to say? You do realize that you are gutting rather\\nlarge portions of the Bible?

Are you Christian or Pauline?\\n\\n\\nAre you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details?\\n\\n\\nYou call observance of the Sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested,\\nceremonial? Has circumcision been superceded for Christians?\\n\\n....\\n\\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\\n\\n[Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is\\nnot, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly with\\nthe question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That\\'s why I\\nhave to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.\\n\\nAs to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studies\\nof Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can\\'t\\ncome up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, various\\nChristian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in\\nother newsgroups.\\n\\nMat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say that\\nit applies to Gentiles.\\n\\nAnd yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on the\\nSabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you\\'re\\nlooking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it\\'s\\nunfortunate the Jesus didn\\'t answer the question directly.

Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it!

(Though I was wrong about your use\\nof the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it\\nsaid the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that\\nhas changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the\\nNicene - Constantinopolitan did not.\\n\\tOf course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene\\nCreed (it wasn\\'t there to begin with), but they certainly did from the\\nAthanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.\\n\\tI might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in\\nways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East\\nemphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father\\nthrough the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the\\nSon.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see\\nbelow)\\n\\n\\t\"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do\\ncall God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the\\nroot and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the\\nriver are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,\\nbut coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must\\nnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on\\nthat account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there\\nare two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is\\nthird from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit\\nof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,\\nand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\"\\n\\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)\\n\\nand\\n\\n\\t\"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father\\nthrough the Son\"\\n\\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)\\n\\nAnd as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,\\nArticles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of\\ngeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession\\nemphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit\\nproceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in\\na more preeminent way.\\n\\n\\t\"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it\\nfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the\\nFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called\\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of\\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\\nmatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy\\nSpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives\\nto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\\nproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of\\nthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\\nmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,\\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both.\"\\n\\t-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\\n\\nSo, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at\\nleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but\\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the\\nprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the\\nFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,\\nthe Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any\\nmention of the Son being necessary.\\n\\tIn any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope\\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\\nDamsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose\\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the\\nFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic\\nposition, which I enunciated above.\\n\\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\\nwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke\\nof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \"to produce,\\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\\nthe Fathers of Nicea.\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of\\nConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\\nConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of\\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,\\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the\\nChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy\\nSpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan\\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council\\nChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy\\nSpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves\\napproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations\\nof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work\\ndone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\\nthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\\nby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians\\nin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until\\nmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was\\nnot disputed, I provide more quotes below.\\n\\n\\t\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\\nGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly\\nclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\\nfrom it.\"\\n\\t-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial\\nTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\\nis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone\\nloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him\\'; and again it\\nis written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he\\nis none of His.\\'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the\\nHoly Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,\\nthat the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,\\' and that `He shall\\nreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.\\'\"\\n\\t-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the\\nappelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to\\nthe Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the\\nFather,\\' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,\\' and `will\\nreceive of mine,\\' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the\\nSon, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit\\ndivine, ... of God, and He is God.

The Earth, by\\nlatest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for\\nabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at\\nmost) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life\\nhas been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before\\nthere were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...\\nmostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just\\nfossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows\\nthat disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what\\nbrought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then\\nhow could it exist before humans?\\n\\n[deletions]\\n\\n Uh...

I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the\\ndegeneration of the genetic code'.\\n\\n\\n Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and\\nbacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is\\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But\\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as\\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\\nthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible\\ndied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed',\\n(forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and\\ndied off for lack of nearby hosts.\\n I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few\\nhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer.

It\\nseems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift\\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\\n\\n\\n Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the\\nphrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect'\\nsystem would be incapable of degrading over time.

Although I\\'m sure it\\'s possible to argue theologically\\nthat we shouldn\\'t make analogies between discrimination on the basis\\nof sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,\\nmorally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the\\nthree forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn\\'t discriminate on the basis of\\nsex, race or sexual orientation.\\n\\nI found the moderator\\'s FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend\\neveryone to read them.\\n\\nThere seem to be three different levels of acceptance:\\n\\n1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever)\\n2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation\\n(though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who\\nindulge\\n3) As 2, but \"love the sinner\"\\n4) Accept homosexuality altogether.\\n\\nMy experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2\\nare limited to a few fundamentalist sects).\\n\\nI suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that\\na 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on\\ndiscovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex,\\nwould not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the\\npressure not to exhibit their feelings.  I\\'m not saying that the\\ncommunity (in particular the parents) would not love the child, but I\\nsuspect the child would not feel loved.',\n",

       "  '\\n\\nI will answer this as I find time.\\n\\n\\nNotice what I said about this book.  I called it \"Easy reading.\"  The reason I\\ndropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical\\nSimon\\'s.  I don\\'t know how many walking encyclopedia\\'s I ran across in\\nphilosphy classes.  The problem isn\\'t in knowing sooooo much more than your\\naverage lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it. \\nSchaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was\\nwritting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was\\nto simple.  I\\'ve talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I\\'ve been in lectures with\\nthe man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof\\'s from secular\\nas well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories) \\nHis answers were enough that the prof\\'s themselves often were taken back and\\ncaused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at\\ndifferent open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well,\\nsimplistic.  It certainly isn\\'t grad level reading.  But we must get off our\\nhigh horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most\\npeople would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to\\nsay about this secular scientist at another time.\\n\\nAlso, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent*\\ninquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt\\nbase.  \\n\\nLook, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must\\nadd a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in\\nkeeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know\\nits limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust\\nit of all value!\\n\\nTHis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.\\n It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian\\nfaith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we\\nfly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic\\nlesson of life: \\n\\n\"More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.\"  \\n\\nOr as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o\\nfreedom.\\n\\nLet\\'s put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to\\nabsurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the\\ndifference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity\\'s contention with\\nrationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very\\nlittle else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust\\ngo hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called\\nto go on by itself without his understanding.\\n\\nThis is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the\\nChristian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment\\nand say, \"Father I do not understand you but I trust you.\"  Now don\\'t read all\\nyour objections of me into that statement.  I wasn\\'t saying I do not understand\\nyou at all, but I trust you anyway.\" It means that \"I do not understand You *in\\nthis situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway\"  Therefore I can\\ntrust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery\\nunrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is\\na statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of\\nFaith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is\\nnot a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know\\nwhy, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all\\nthe difference.\\n\\nNow, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted\\ncompany with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit\\nmore difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith\\nlike the insistent \"whying\" of a 3 year old.  It isn\\'t just that we would like\\nto know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot\\nknow.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other\\nleads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in\\ncoming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after\\ncoming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need\\nto know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp\\nthat, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may\\ncount decisevely against what we are able to trust.  \\n\\nIf, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust\\nhim in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian\\nleaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which\\nallows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be\\nambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to\\nus, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity.\\nAnd that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in\\npractice.   ',\n",

Sure the war could have been\\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\\nresponsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a\\nstrong response from the West was required.\\n\\n\\nWell, it\\'s not very \"loving\" to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up\\nnearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass\\nslaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I\\'d have to\\nsay yes, stopping Hussein was the most \"loving\" thing to do for the\\nmost people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.\\n\\nI mentioned it.\\n\\nIf we hadn\\'t intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would\\nhave been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned\\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.

But then\\nI learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict\\non a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably\\nwould have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated\\nassault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which\\nnews commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California\\nlaw.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it\\'s evident that \\nthe first jury decided that the officers were \"not guilty\".  Note, \\nnot \"not guilty\" of doing wrong, but \"not guilty\" of aggravated assault \\nwith the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.

From a theological bent, those who lived\\nimmediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son\\nNimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a\\nstronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of\\nhardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on\\nhis shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.\\n It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and\\nthus he became the \"Elevator of the heavens.\"  This \"god\" made men able to\\n\"feel\" as if heaven were afar off and \"as if either the God of Heaven could not\\nsee through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of\\nHis laws.\"  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled \"Emancipator\"\\nor \"Deliverer\"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system\\nand abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many\\nbenefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a\\nDeliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God\\'s wrath, the other\\nactually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it\\nas true.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to\\nthe coming \"Anointed One\" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who\\nwas to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the\\nCrucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the\\ndispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it\\nas a completed action.  Rom\\'s makes it clear that it has always been salvation\\nvia faith and nothing else.\\n\\n\\nI understand what you\\'re trying to convey, but I don\\'t think I\\'d lay hold of it\\nbecause the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the\\neternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal\\nlife is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of\\nconsciousness.  \\n\\n\\nIt depends upon your def of \"lost.\"  The elect were lost only in time as\\noutside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world. \\nExistentially we were all born \"lost\", but the \"righteous\" were \"in Christ\" and\\ntherefore never *assuredly* lost.  \\n\\nMaybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it.

This was my point.\\n\\n\\nAh!  This is it.  This is the big question.

That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings\\nto light. The \"Mystery of Iniquity\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to\\nthis I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,\\nlittle by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would\\nnot have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.

       "  'The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for\\nsome time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a\\nsymbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that\\nthe _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar,\\nRelics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real,\\nalmost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real\\nsacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all\\nto be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking\\nprecludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it\\nsimply IS holy.\\n\\nBut, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if\\nwell- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely\\nto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which\\ncould be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the\\nmass has become a commercial for God\\'s grace rather than the real\\nthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn\\'t\\ndare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have\\nbeen encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing\\non _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in\\nliturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or\\nthe heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic\\nexample of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of\\nthe sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita\\nbread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered\\nin particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but\\nCatholics in the past would have been distraught at this real\\ndesacration of the real symbol of Jesus\\' body.\\n\\nModern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We\\ntry to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac\\npriest get up and \\'explain\\' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and\\nstart pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience.\\nIt doesn\\'t help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and\\nthree chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated\\ntunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the\\ngenius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize\\' is only\\nslightly better.\\n\\nWhat are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it\\ndoesn\\'t work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well\\nprepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW\\na matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is\\nthe attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative\\nliturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean\\nthe Church will be socially conservative.\\n\\nIn NYC I can recommend:\\n\\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St.\\n\\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, \\n\\tSt. Joseph\\'s, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \"clean\", largely gay\\n\\tOratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful\\n\\nAvoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.\\n\\nHappy Easter: Christos Aneste\\', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is Risen',\n",

I thought the whole idea of God coming\\ndown to earth to live as one of us \"subject to sin and death\" (as one of\\nthe consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was\\nthat Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the\\nbasic definition of humanity, then Jesus \"fully human\" (Nicea) would not\\nbe \"subject to sin\", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,\\nbecause we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish\\nbetween \"human\" and \"fallen human\" makes Jesus less like one of us at the\\ntime we need him most.\\n\\n\\nFirst, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius\\'s version -- they \\nwere on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical\\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \\nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius\\'s\\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\\na la Chalcedon.\\n\\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\\nthat Jesus\\'s human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\\nprevailed.\\n\\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\\n\\nJason Albert\\n\\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn\\'t see how we could call\\nJesus fully human, because he didn\\'t sin.  I completely agree that\\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\\n\\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\\'s reason to think\\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\\ngot the better of them.\\n\\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\\nmust be understood that there\\'s a certain indirectness in the Logos\\'\\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don\\'t have an\\nincarnation at all.

       "  '\\n   You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I\\'m not trying to be\\n   contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\\n   and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\\n   What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\\n   Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\\n   This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\\n   stood by the Pope.\\n\\nThe ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This\\nis the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his\\ndeparture from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands\\nfrom *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be\\ndisobeyed.\\n\\nMy own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major\\nway.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it\\nwould be too complex for people to figure out.  I don\\'t view the\\npresent situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated.\\nRun through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the\\nCatholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.\\n\\n   It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\\n   disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\\n   authority and discipline.  \\n\\nThe problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic\\nFaith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the\\nCatholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring\\nbishops.  It\\'s basically the Reformation part II.\\n\\nThere is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the\\nshards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the\\nCatholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an\\nhour, probably.\\n\\nTake the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I\\'m reading a book\\non what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio\\nde Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the\\nwake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old\\ncatechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the\\nCatholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He\\ninnoculated the people against what was coming.\\n\\nWell, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came\\nwhen the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope\\nrecovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really\\nwanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence.\\nThe Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.\\n\\nThe injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop\\nwas installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer\\'s\\nclergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New\\nMass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass.\\nThe people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop\\nwas *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of\\nthe secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The\\npriests would just start building new churches; the people were\\ncompletely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the\\nbishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.\\n\\nThe prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to\\ncanon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the\\ntraditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V.\\nNor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.\\n\\nDuring all this process, the people of Campos, not just private\\nindividuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending\\npetitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist\\nbishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome.\\nEventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.\\n\\n   My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\\n\\n\\t Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\\n\\t could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\\n\\t the Pope\\'s position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\\n\\t don\\'t jointly make such  choice.)\\n\\n   If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\\n   If I adopt the view that \"I\\'m NOT wrong, I CAN\\'T be wrong, and\\n   there\\'s NO WAY I\\'ll change my mind, YOU must change yours\", that\\n   I\\'ve either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\\n\\nIf the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end\\nof the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in\\nCatholic theology, and anyone who doesn\\'t go along with it is an\\ninstant non-Catholic.\\n\\nThe problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in\\nthe Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are\\ndoing, they would be shocked!\\n\\n   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \"real\"\\n   traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter\\n   East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body\\nof traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are\\nespecially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional\\ndoctrine is.\\n\\n   I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow\\n   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`\\n   I may be wrong here, I\\'m not Roman Catholic. :-)\\n\\nThat\\'s heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job\\nsince the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors\\nspread that it\\'s pitiful.\\n\\nInfallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the\\nshort term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In\\nfact, that\\'s what usually happens during a major heresy: large\\nsections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been\\nmuch more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long\\nrun.\\n\\n   What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement\\n   regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how\\n   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?\\n   Again, I\\'m not trying to be contentions, I\\'m trying to understand.\\n   Since I\\'m Orthodox, I\\'ve got no real vested interest in the outcome,\\n   one way or the other.\\n\\nYes, it would be honored.

       "  'A \"new Christian\" wrote that he was new to the faith and \\nlearning about it \"by reading the Bible, of course\". I am not\\nat all sure this is the best path to follow.\\n\\tWhile the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the \\nrevelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this\\nrevalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one\\ndenommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian\\ncongregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just\\nreading the Bible.\\n\\tThis does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although\\nI would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the\\nBook of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are\\ncomfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to\\nread the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable\\nlack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really\\nsturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.\\n\\tThe point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith\\nof Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital\\nbeliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned -\\nthe Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church\\norganization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the\\nlived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one\\nhopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies\\nin the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.\\n\\tFollowing up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I \\nwould even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the\\nchristian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing\\nthe nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into\\nthe christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading\\nGraham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard\\nManley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene\\'s _Monsignor\\nQuixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian,\\nbut such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly,\\nI often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after\\nreading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being\\na Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in\\nsome way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by\\nthe person of Jesus Christ.',\n",

I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as\\nmany other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that\\nChristians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if\\nyou believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily\\nbeing arrogant.

The \\ndistinction is subtle yet important.\\n\\nWhen a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results\\nare reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could\\nhave been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken,\\nwithout sacrificing his convictions.\\n\\nNobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty.\\nThroughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know\\nwith complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the\\nright direction when he uttered, \"Cogito, ergo sum,\" yet we have not advanced\\nmuch beyond that.\\n\\nDo you believe that other people aside from you exist?

The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about\\nabsolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability \\nthat they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do) \\nabandon these absolutes.\\n\\n\\nAs I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.

Note the early use of\\nPostScript technology, predating many of this year\\'s papers listed in the\\nApril 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.\\n\\n-- Eric\\n\\n\\nIntersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),\\n\\tby Dave Baraff, Tom Duff\\n\\n\\tFrom: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu\\n\\tNewsgroups: comp.graphics\\n\\tKeywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem\\n\\tOrganization: Program of Computer Graphics\\n\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

By the well known\\nDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.\\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.

       "  '\\nThe \"so sacred it\\'s secret\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While\\nthere is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no\\ninjunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But\\nsince public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather\\nkeep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.\\n\\nBut there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants\\nexplicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the\\nceremony itself.\\n\\n\\nThere are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.\\nOne must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was\\nwritten by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret\\ninformation to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that\\nthose apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve\\n(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).\\n\\nIrenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and\\nbishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He\\nclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the\\napostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which\\nwe today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,\\nop. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*\\ngnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.\\n\\nWritings dealing with Jesus\\' post-resurrection teachings emphasize\\nsecrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching\\ncertain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a\\ndialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter\\'s response is \"You seem\\nto me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you\\nboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not\\npermitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine\\nRecognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_\\nit is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but\\ncan be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.\\n\\nNow one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I\\ndon\\'t intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I\\nbelieve that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of\\nearly Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.\\n\\n\\nBut if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect\\nto read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of\\nMormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on\\ntemple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in\\ntemples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that\\nworship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*\\npractices which might have taken place, and that absence of such\\ndescriptions proves they did not exist?\\n\\nMormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from\\nwhich I have taken a few:\\n\\n1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of\\nheaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).\\n\\n2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\"\\n(Matt. 19:11).\\n\\n3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\\nnow\" (John 16:12).\\n\\n4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,\\nbut I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).\\n\\n5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\"\\n(1 Cor. 3:1-2).\\n\\n6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...\\ncome unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).\\n\\n(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)\\n\\nAgain, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe\\nthey serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught\\nwere actually taught openly.\\n\\n\\nHistorically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple\\nendowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.\\nThere is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not\\nchange after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had\\nample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his\\ntime and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific\\nconnection has yet been established.\\n\\nMy conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite\\ntranscriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe\\nthat the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As\\nour moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the\\nrecent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who\\ncharge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have\\nadequate knowledge of the rites in question.\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n         Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City\\n                    jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu',\n",

       "  \"This is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this \\ndoctrine:\\n\\n\\n                        THE DOCTRINE OF GOD\\n\\n\\nI.   THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD\\n     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most\\n     important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God. \\n     Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should\\n     be to know God.\\n     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three\\n     Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the\\n     Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I\\n     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in\\n     nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each\\n     possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also\\n     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.\\n     Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.\\n\\nII.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.\\n     A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for\\n         Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and\\n         unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without\\n         ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.\\n     B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.\\n     C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.\\n         As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,\\n         patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;\\n         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.\\n     D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely\\n         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of\\n         sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.\\n         6:3.\\n     E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time\\n         in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all\\n         knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,\\n         infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with\\n         unlimited power over all creation).\\n         God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It\\n         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day\\n         has become very man-centered, and that the people in our\\n         churches know very little about God.  I believe that the\\n         Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the\\n         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign\\n         in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives\\n         of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes\\n         regarding salvation.\\n\\nIII.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.\\n     A.  In creation\\n          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in\\n          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining\\n          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs\\n          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end\\n          of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;\\n          Heb. 1:3.\\n     B.  In salvation\\n         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is\\n         absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man. \\n         All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,\\n         active in salvation.\\n         1.  God, the Father\\n             Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the\\n             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would\\n             be salvation, the conditions under which people\\n             could and would be saved, and even who would be\\n             saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in\\n             Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph\\n             1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.\\n         2.  Christ, the Son of God\\n             The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the\\n             virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two\\n             important works:\\n             a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of\\n                  God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.\\n             b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the\\n                  Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on\\n                  the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by\\n                  His present intercessory work in heaven.  The\\n                  work of salvation will be completed for us when\\n                  the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-\\n                  4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.\\n         3.  The Holy Spirit\\n             As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is\\n             Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is\\n             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the\\n             following ways:\\n             a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11\\n             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new\\n                  birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.\\n             c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work\\n                  of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.\\n             d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making \\n                  salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.\\n             e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of\\n                  Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13\\n             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of\\n                  Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.\\n             g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of \\n                  God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12\\n             h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.\\n             i.   He empowers for living and for service.  \\n                  Cf. Acts 1:8\\n\\n\",\n",

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \\nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \\nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\\n\\nBut first let me say the following.\\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\\'s rather pointless\\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\\nI\\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it\\'s\\n\\'usual sense\\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\\nGod\".\\n \\nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\\n\\nfaith \\n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\\nb  (1): fidelity to one\\'s promises\\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n   (2): complete trust\\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nof religious beliefs\\nsyn see BELIEF\\n\\n\\n\\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \\npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \\ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \\nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead.

I suspect that what happened\\nto him is what he\\'ll call being \"born again\"?  Anyway, was that recent?\\nIf the answer is \"yes\" to all the questions above, it is quite\\nunderstandable.  However, IMO, I\\'ld rather give advice to your friend!\\nI think I\\'ve been through something similar to him, and one thing I can\\nsay is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to\\ncommunicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things\\nis because they are now \"obvious\" to him.  What is \"obvious\" to him is\\nnot obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because\\nfrom his point of view, he has been on \"both sides of the fence\".  This\\nI mean that before he turned \"fundamentalist\", you two are agreeable\\nbecause both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if\\na new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the\\ndiscovery of let\\'s say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he\\'s\\ngot to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than\\nwhere he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now.\\nYou have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to\\nyou, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that\\nrisk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand\\nand listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because\\nhe is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about,\\nhowever, he may not realise that he\\'s really putting you off.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\n\\nSo far, I\\'ve only been trying to explain things from his side.  However,\\nI do understand how you feel too, because I wasn\\'t a Christian for a good\\npart of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or\\n\"fundamentalists\" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their\\nfaith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately,\\n\"religious belief\" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism\\nis also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is\\ninevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise),\\nit will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both\\nsides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can\\ndo your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he\\'s\\ntrying to convince you about, that it\\'s beyond you or not your concern\\n\"for now\".  Don\\'t tell him it\\'s nonsense, because to him it is reality -\\nand that would be a real insult.  He\\'ll also have to be careful not to\\ninsult where you stand too.\\n\\nLike I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too.\\nI\\'ll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a\\nChristian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little\\ndifferently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited\\nand just blabbered away about what I\\'ve found!  To me, it was too good\\nnot to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn\\'t really care most of\\nthe time what they thought.  You will probably think he\\'s crazy too -\\nbut God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in\\nmind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real\\nto him, he doesn\\'t see why God can\\'t be real to you too.\\n\\nI don\\'t know how helpful this is to you.

Without this basic \\nasumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We\\nshould distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \"believe\",\\nhowever. The weak sense means I am not sure. \"I believe Tom went to \\nthe library.\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense\\nmeans I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \"I believe \\nthat nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\" (despite \\nthe fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian\\nbelief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs\\nof the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological \\ntopics.)\\n \\n\\nNote that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the \\nmajority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that\\nif Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be\\nfalse, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity. \\n(And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)\\n \\n\\nIt is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless \\nthey have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks\\nand wants.\\n\\n\\nMost Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living\\ntradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly\\nby the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.\\n\\n\\nIf depends what you mean by differing.

If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive\\nthat he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.\\n \\n\\nThus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being \\ncan find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find \\nabsolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who\\ndoes not share your belief on this point is wrong.

Saying that the glass \\nis half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half\\nfull: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole\\npoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist\\nand the optimist express the *same* fact.)\\n \\nIt is, of course, quite true that different people may express the \\nsame belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail\\nto understand each other\\'s words as expressions of the same belief\\nand may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great\\nscisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has\\nbeen done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal\\nagreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs\\nare equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict\\nsome other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations\\nof language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have\\nbeen stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must,\\n**necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical\\nto say so.

He called hell, \"outer\\ndarkness.\"  \\n\\nDo you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over\\nhere, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are\\nprostituting their bodies over there?  That\\'s not what hell is.  Hell\\'s not a\\nparty.  There\\'s no fellowship there.  He called it \"outer darkness.\"  \"Outer\"\\n-away from God.  \"Darkness\" -God is light.  \\n\\nNo when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated\\nJesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That\\'s is a sobering thought.  As my\\nson would say, an \"awesome\" thought.  \\n\\n\"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  Hell is isolation.  There\\'s no\\nfellowship in hell.  There\\'s no friendship in hell.  There\\'s no loving embrace\\nin hell.  There\\'s no hand shake in hell.  There\\'s no word of encouragement in\\nhell.  \\n\\n\"I thirst.\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving\\nwith no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it\\neternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman\\'s body, will\\ncrave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way\\nand I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of\\nenvironment that matches the internal condition of the lost.  \\n\\nIn a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life\\nministries.  I\\'ve remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the\\nillustration that I gave wasn\\'t his.  His illustration was that he was talking\\nto his barber and his barber\\'s wife and daughter had just recently been saved\\nand he was commenting about it to Jack.  \"They sing these songs and read Bible\\nverses, and their praising this and that -I can\\'t stand it!  Jack, do you think\\nGod would send me to hell?\"  Jack answered by saying, \"Yes I think he would!\" \\nOf course the barber said, \"What do you mean by that.\"  \"Well if you can\\'t\\nstand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to\\nGod now, what would you do in heaven where they\\'ll do it for eternity?  You\\'d\\nbe miserable.  Because God loves you, He\\'d put you where it would match what\\nyou really are.\"   It makes a man think.\\n\\nThe crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal\\nexistence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don\\'t ask\\nme how, I don\\'t know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He\\ndied, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He\\npurchased eternal life for the \"whosoever wills.\"  He suffered eternal\\njudgment.  \\n\\nA lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \"Everybody is going\\nto be saved eventually.\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He\\'ll separate\\nthem.  The sheep from the goats.  \".After you die there\\'s a probationary period\\nin which God prepares you for heaven.\"  No, my Bible says that \"It is appointed\\nunto men once to die and then comes judgment.\"  Some of the cultist believe in\\nannihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you\\'re squished\\nout.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as\\nthere is in heaven.  \\n\\nI don\\'t enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don\\'t enjoy\\nlistening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a\\nplace called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any\\nhope that people aren\\'t going there, I\\'d give it to you, but I haven\\'t found\\nit.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a\\nGod of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of\\ncreatures we are and therefore we\\'re responsible, the fact that He has placed\\nus in a \"uni\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is\\nsuch an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us\\nfrom hell leads us to two applications.\\n\\n1)  As I\\'ve already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others. \\nIts not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just\\naround the bend the bridge is out.  \"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we\\npersuade men.\"\\n\\n2)  If you haven\\'t accepted Jesus are your Savior, you\\'re taking an awful\\nchance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if\\nyou are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die\\nand cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and\\nsuffer eternal damnation.  I don\\'t mean to make fun at this point, but its like\\nDirty Harry said, \"You\\'ve got to ask yourself, \\'Do I feel lucky?\\'  Well do\\nyou?\"  \"A man\\'s got to know his limitations.\"  Don\\'t be one of the \"whosoever\\nwont\\'s.\"  ',\n",
       "  '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOkay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\\nand is well referenced. \\n\\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\\n\\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \\nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\\n\\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\\n\\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \\nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\\n\\n\\nThere is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is\\ntaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and\\nfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from\\nearly Islamic history is the Prophet\\'s widow, Aisha, who was recognized\\nin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.\\n\\n\\nYou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and\\nI dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I\\nrecently reposted something here under the heading \"Islam and Women\" --\\nif it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted\\nfrom soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it\\nstill might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title\\nwas though).  I will email it to you if you like. \\n\\n\\nYour statement that \"other religions are no different\" is, I think, a\\nstatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than\\nChristianity and perhaps Judaism.\\n\\n\\nAisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also\\nwas, at one stage, a military leader.\\n\\n\\nThe Prophet\\'s first wife, who died just before the \"Hijra\" (the\\nProphet\\'s journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.\\n\\nLucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your\\nviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.',\n",
       "  '\\n\\n\\n# I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: I simply don\\'t agree\\n# with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force.\\n\\n\\n\\n# And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the\\n# Holy Qur\\'an, the Bible, etc.  There have been times in the spiritual\\n# and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical\\n# descriptions of Heaven, Hell, and Satan were taken quite literally\\n# and that *worked* for the time.  As I mentioned in the Tradition\\n# cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory\\n# about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \"evil\"\\n# which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \"satanic.\"\\n\\n     Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is\\n     metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not\\n     the same way?\\n\\n# The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane\\n# in human language is something like describing \"color\" to a person\\n# who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book\\n# FLATLAND (if you haven\\'t already) or THE DRAGON\\'S EGG.  The first\\n# is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con-\\n# cept...\\n\\n[some deleted for space saving]\\n\\n# When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe\\n# another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then\\n# such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be\\n# necessary.  The \"unseen\" is described in terms which have reference`\\n# and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro-\\n# mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness\\n# of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all\\n# crippled.  But what else can you do?\\n\\n     This is why I asked the above.  How would you then\\n     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than\\n     just being metaphorical?  I mean, it\\'s okay to say\\n     \"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\" but then you\\n     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is\\n     not some metaphor for something else.\\n\\n     I say this because there are many, many instances of\\n     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in \\n     the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the\\n     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is\\n     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know\\n     one is metaphorical and not the other.\\n\\n     Further, belief in God isn\\'t a bar to evil.  Let\\'s\\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\\n     in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a \\n     case where someone does believe in God, but by\\n     religious standards, they are \"evil.\"  If Bobby\\n     does see this, let him address this question also.\\n\\n[deleted some more on \"metaphor\"]\\n\\n\\nStephen\\n\\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\\n\\n',\n",

In my follow-up to Jason Smith\\'s posting, I will\\naddress some issues that have caused misunderstanding:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic\\non the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not\\nescape your notice. \\n\\nThe correct word is \\'likely\\'. There is no way to be sure our models and\\ntheories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence,\\nbut not proved - no theory can be \\'true\\' in a mathematical sense.\\n\\nHowever, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of\\nphenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can\\n_predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories\\nscience has come up with have passed this test, including the Big\\nBang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc.\\nIt does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere\\n\\'best fits\\' for the data. \\n\\n\\n\\nWell, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science\\nrequires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if\\nthe theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason.\\nDisbelievers are not punished. \\n\\n\\nThis is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_?\\nMy fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is\\nunable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God. \\n\\nYes, I know that one can\\'t believe without God\\'s help; Luther makes\\nthis quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I\\'m afraid this does not\\nchange my situation. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(deletions)\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy,\\neither something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody\\nwould ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but\\nactually no existing being could give an answer. \\n\\nImagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also\\nask: \"Why nothing exists?\" This is equivalent to my counter-question,\\n\"why nothing exists in nothingness\". \\n\\nNow, \"why anything exists\" is equivalent to \"why something exists in\\nsomethingness\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies\\nfor the poor wording in my previous post.\\n\\n\\nI do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence,\\nin general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still\\nleave open the question \"why this, and not that\", and this is where\\ntheistic explanations come in.\\n\\nScience cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being\\'s existence.\\n\\n\\nThis is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not?\\nAlso, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has\\nno meaning in His case. \\n\\nIf I am for a reason, I\\'ve yet failed to see what it would be. \\nFrom our perspective, it looks like \\'I\\' exist for truly random\\nreasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can\\nI believe there is any better reason for my existence?\\n\\n\\nYes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better.\\nMy 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have\\nto admit, but I am patient.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, it doesn\\'t, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists,\\nfor an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this\\nshould not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.\\n\\n\\nIt is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question \\n\"why do I exist, in particular\" is _not_ an invalid question - this\\nis not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to\\ntell, and I can\\'t just believe in any given explanation instead of\\nanother, especially since I found I was deluding myself. \\n\\n\\nI think \"pre-existence\" is an oxymoron. There is no time \\'outside\\' of\\nthis spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that \\nperspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who\\nare inside it. \\n\\n\\nNo. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think\\nphilosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not\\nknowable?\\n\\n\\nThis is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous\\nother questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base\\nmy faith on. \\n\\nI think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, \"why do I believe\"\\nor \"why I don\\'t believe\". \\n\\nPetri\\n',\n",

They believe they\\'re going to _die_. Understand\\nthat you\\'ve turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows\\nthat all animals are \\'going to Hell.\\' Are you sure this is what you want\\nto say? (presumably animals don\\'t have the opportunity to get to heaven,\\nbut this still doesn\\'t change the fact that they\\'re going to Hell (die\\na final death))\\n\\n   I don\\'t claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_\\nsort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and\\nnot eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that\\nthere will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence. \\n(assuming I \\'go to Hell\\' and not to Heaven) In other words, I\\'ll\\nnever know I\\'m dead. Hmmm... \\n\\n\\n\\n    Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:\\n \"At least she\\'s not suffering any more; She\\'s in Heaven now.\" ?\\n\\n    Consider the following statement:\\n \"At least she\\'s not suffering any more; She\\'s in Hell now.\"\\n\\n    The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell, \\nit would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering. \\nGranted, they wouldn\\'t be *anything* (wouldn\\'t be having any\\nconscious experience whatsoever). \\n\\n    You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning \\nto a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort \\nof eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to\\nbe conscious throughout this eternity. \\n\\n    Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the\\nproduct of propaganda (\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\"\\nIt\\'s my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife.\\nCan anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all\\nanimals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the\\nidea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of\\nsuper-survival. \\n\\n \\n\\n    That would depend on what Heaven is like.

The only person who is required to\\nbelieve a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed.\\nDevotional practices may be based on reported private revelations,\\nbut doctrines can not.\\n\\nWhen an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the\\nChurch may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood\\nthat the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be\\napproved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However,\\nit is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from\\nGod.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most\\nwell attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those\\nat Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject\\nFatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not\\nmean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)\\n\\nI do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in\\nevaluating an alleged private revelation--it\\'s not something I need\\nevery day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that\\nnothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything\\nknown through public revelation\\n-------\\nMarty Helgesen\\nBitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu',\n",

       "  'THE EMPTY TOMB:  CAN WE TRUST IT?\\n\\n                   by the late Wilbur M. Smith, D.D.\\n                              (1894-1977)\\n\\n          When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about\\n     Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:\\n\\n                 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son\\n               of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief\\n               priests and unto the scribes, and they shall\\n               condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him\\n               to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and\\n               to crucify Him; and the third day He shall\\n               rise again\" (Matthew 20:18-19).\\n\\n          Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,\\n     who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving\\n     reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He\\n     knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious\\n     leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that\\n     one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual\\n     death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly\\n     how He would die--*by crucifixion.*\\n\\n          All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the\\n     minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted\\n     would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise\\n     again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.\\n\\n          But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-\\n     tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-\\n     tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.\\n\\n          The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth\\n     between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and\\n     ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which\\n     had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against\\n     the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had\\n     predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and\\n     on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the\\n     disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some\\n     of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the\\n     tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,\\n     they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back\\n     to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus\\' friends, Peter and\\n     John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the\\n     tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came\\n     hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them\\n     to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).\\n\\n          How did this tomb become empty?\\n\\n          One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--\\n     professor of New Testament literature in a large theological\\n     seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*\\n     the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by\\n     bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb\\n     became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the\\n     chimney at Christmas time.\\n\\n          But he didn\\'t realize that Santa Clause never did come down\\n     any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa\\n     Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the\\n     tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.\\n\\n          Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-\\n     bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by\\n     mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.\\n\\n          Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,\\n     tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar\\n     in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)\\n     that the women went to the wrong tomb.\\n\\n          The facts are these:\\n\\n          First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to\\n     which by mistake they could have gone.\\n\\n          Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or\\n     more people to forget the place where they have buried their\\n     dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women\\n     did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to\\n     the wrong tomb?\\n\\n          Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?\\n\\n          There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the\\n     evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.\\n\\n                  Now when they were going, behold, some\\n               of the watch came into the city and showed\\n               unto the chief priests all the things that\\n               were done.  And when they were assembled\\n               with the leaders and had taken counsel, they\\n               gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,\\n               Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole\\n               Him away while we slept.  And if this come to\\n               the governor\\'s ears, we will persuade him, and\\n               secure you.  So they took the money, and did\\n               as they were taught:  and this saying is com-\\n               monly reported among the Jews until this day\\n               (Matthew 28:11-15).\\n\\n          This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the\\n     fact that the tomb was empty.\\n\\n          You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never\\n     questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to\\n     see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.\\n\\n          Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that\\n     the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus\\' disciples\\n     came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*\\n\\n          How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?\\n     Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.\\n\\n          Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject\\n     the explanation, the very character and the later history of the\\n     disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away\\n     the body of Jesus.\\n\\n          First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in\\n     Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to\\n     contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His\\n     resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there\\n     had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,\\n     then proved.\\n\\n          Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would\\n     have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.\\n     It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most\\n     of these men did.\\n\\n          The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ\\n     had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it\\n     would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed\\n     pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing\\n     humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today\\n     as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.\\n\\n          But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to\\n     leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to\\n     what had happened to Him.\\n\\n          Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.\\n\\n          He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning\\n     (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-\\n     18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He\\n     walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that\\n     night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper\\n     room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).\\n\\n          A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at\\n     the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren\\n     on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the\\n     apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-\\n     8).\\n\\n          As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-\\n     ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed\\n     attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are\\n     unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the\\n     unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the\\n     appearances.\\n\\n          Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our\\n     leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are\\n     antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest\\n     thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.\\n     Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;\\n     Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of\\n     Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president\\n     of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.\\n\\n          But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has\\n     it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:\\n     it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.\\n\\n          Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He\\n     claimed to have come down *from* God.\\n\\n          He said He was the way *to* God.\\n\\n          He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.\\n\\n          He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one\\n     else had it.\\n\\n          He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to\\n     us.\\n\\n          Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed\\n     that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*\\n\\n          Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe\\n     that His words are all true?\\n\\n          The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us\\n     that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?\\n\\n          And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead\\n     testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some\\n     day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.\\n\\n          In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all\\n     this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For\\n     He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-\\n     ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a\\n     hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.',\n",

Also the parent from single\\n: parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must,\\n: by your arguement, die.\\n\\nBy your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. As to your\\nsecond point, you prove again that you have no idea what context\\nmeans. I am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species,\\nthe fundamental premise of the whole process.\\n: \\n: |> But it gets worse.

But wait, there\\'s\\n: |> more.\\n: |> \\n: \\n: Read the above.  I expect you to have at least ten children by now, with\\n: the family growing.  These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly\\n: without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill\\n: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.\\n: These days is just ain\\'t true!  People can decide whether or not to have \\n: children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it\\'s sex &c (but that\\'s \\n: another arguement...) so it\\'s more of a \"lifestyle\" decision.  Again by\\n: your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must\\n: be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are \\n: as \"unnatural\" as each other.\\n\\nYet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists\\nfor procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That\\nhomosexuals don\\'t procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and\\nnothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.\\n\\n: \\n: |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some\\n: |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that\\n: |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a\\n: |> choice that should be protected by law.

If so, fancy a date?\\n\\nHere\\'s pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you\\'ve said anything\\nor do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? I am not\\ntelling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are arguments\\nagainst the practice of homosexuality (providing it\\'s a merely an\\nalternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably\\ncall it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realize\\nof course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value,\\nand that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you\\nare to be consistent, you have no case in this regard.\\n: \\n: |> To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to\\n: |> ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of\\n: |> the homosexual \"life-style\".

Supported, and parts available,\\nyes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!\\n\\n\\nI missed your first posting, but as I say, by all means share your\\nfrustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might\\nhave an effect (not immediate, I'm sure, but complaints aren't\\ngoing to be ignored, and *may* affect future plans, if we \\nhear similar things from more than one person/site).\\n\\nAll of the above is, as usual, my personal opinion, not SGI's.\",\n",
       "  \"\\n\\nI beg to disagree with the assertion that science is a collection of models.\\nScientific models are a game to play, and are only as good as the\\nassumptions and measurements (if any) that go into them.\\n\\nAs an example, I remember when nuclear winter was the big hype in\\natmospheric science.  It wasn't long after Sagan's admonitions that\\none of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of\\nthe nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assume\\nthat the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one-\\ndimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds\\nblow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed\\na transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they\\nwere generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation\\nbetween the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness\\nfrom reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan's\\nmodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model \\nin sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to\\nour boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in\\nthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.\\nHe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,\\nthe biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would\\nprobably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even\\nless than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.\\n\\nTo quote from H.S. Yoder,\\n\\n\\tThe postulated models have become accepted as the reality\\n\\tinstead of the lattice of assumptions they are.\\n\\tAuthoritarianism dominates the field, and a very critical\\n\\tanalysis of each argument is to be encouraged.... Skepticism\\n\\tof the model approach to earth problems is warranted because\\n\\tmany key parameters have not been included.\\n\\nThis statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony.  Only when\\nconvincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled results\\nmay one suggest that the model may describe the reality.  Just thought\\nI'd clear that up before things really got out of hand. \\n \\n-- \\nboundary\",\n",

However, expressing\\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\\n    exceed their technical skills.\\n\\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\\n    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\\n\\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\\n    composing imagery for understanding.\\n\\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\\n    computer graphics context.\\n\\n\\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\\n\\n        Psychology/Perception:\\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\\n            Beverly J.

       "  '\\nThe number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and \\nexploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The\\nfacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians \\nin any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly\\nto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques\\nwhich were technically possible only recently.\\n\\nThe idea that \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi citizens died is\\nludicrous.  Not even \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi soldiers died,\\nand they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US\\nand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?\\nEither the smart bombs didn\\'t hit their targets (and we know they did),\\nor they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to\\ndestroying Iraq\\'s military potential.  The military mission planners are\\nnot fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.\\nHitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,\\nnot a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their\\ntyrant-dictator. \\n\\nHow about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2?\\nI don\\'t hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but\\nwith smart bombs, it\\'s becoming more exact with a smaller percentage\\nof civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are\\nmisidentified; innocents die.  That\\'s war the way it really is.\\nBut the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth\\nlike it\\'s one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is\\nworse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \"I know not what\\ncourse others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me\\ndeath!\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one\\nwishes to stay free.   \\n\\n\\nMathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.\\nYou come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I\\nfeel sure that was not your intent.\\n\\nSo the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I\\'m sure that appeasement would have\\nworked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we\\nshouldn\\'t have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\\nGerman civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.

His kind don\\'t understand\\ndiplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is\\nthat Bush wimped out and didn\\'t have the military roll into Baghdad, so\\nnow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people\\'s sacrifice (not to\\nmention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait \\nwas a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would\\'ve been better!\\n\\nAnd as for poor, poor Rodney King!

When the\\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\\n\\n\"A Maze of Death\"\\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\\n\\n\"VALIS\"\\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\\n\\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\\n\\nMARGARET ATWOOD\\n\\n\"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\"\\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\\n\\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\\n\\n\"The Bible\"\\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you\\'ll know what all the fuss is\\nabout.

Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France\\nand Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England\\ndevelopments.  \"Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,\\nWithout God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate\\nof a single idea, the belief that God exists.\" \\n316 pages.

In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\\n\\nJ. L. MACKIE\\n\\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\\nformalistic and better written than Martin\\'s works, and refreshingly direct\\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\\n\\nJAMES A.

       "  '\\n\\n This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the \\n belief that you can\\'t deny anything that you can\\'t prove doesn\\'t exist.\\n This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are\\n conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have\\n to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe\\n in objects or beings that haven\\'t been proved not to exist so why stop at\\n God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan\\n except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond\\n hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can\\'t see them)  The \\n reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians\\n have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.\\n\\n\\n How did they shoot themselves in the foot?\\n\\n\\n  There is a big difference here, Stalin didn\\'t say that he stood for a \\n  particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and\\n  then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least\\n  an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this\\n  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because\\n  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the\\n  russians that helped Stalin that weren\\'t atheists - don\\'t they contradict\\n  your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant\\n  to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists\\n  can\\'t value life as much as theists (which you didn\\'t support).  \\n\\n\\n Ah, and here\\'s another point you didn\\'t get out of the FAQ.  An atheist\\n doesn\\'t have to hold the positive view that god doesn\\'t exist, he/she may\\n just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here\\'s the example:\\n \\n Strong atheism - \"I believe god does not exist\"   a positive belief\\n\\n Weak atheism   - \"I don\\'t believe in a god\"       a negative belief\\n \\n these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of\\n god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that\\n you are calling unreasonable.  Or let\\'s look at it this way (in sets)\\n \\n suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent\\n as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas\\n exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person\\n not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that\\n even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:\\n \\n christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god\\n \\n atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)\\n \\n atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set\\n \\n agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E\\', ....) \\n\\n\\n\\n Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not\\n  will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always \\n  prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival\\n  trait, evolution has drilled it in us to take positions, even false ones.\\n\\n',\n",

That was last year...I kid\\nyou not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.\\n\\nIn out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding\\ndates..(which is true for me, but I know it can\\'t be for her).\\nShe has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended\\nup leaving school....Now we are at the present...\\n\\nLet me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....\\n\\n\\n\"Okay, now I\\'m going to try to explain my life to you. I\\'m not\\ngoing to KU anymore because something just isn\\'t right. College\\njust wasn\\'t clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and\\nthat just isn\\'t my way. I wasn\\'t taking any classes that truly interested\\nme & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was\\ninterested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with \\nkids, but \\'it\\' just didn\\'t work for me at this university. And my parents\\ncould tell.\\n\\n\"So I\\'m working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now\\nI have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room\\nM-W-F. I\\'ve really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and \\nit\\'s great experience.\\n\\n\"As of now, I\\'m not planning on going back to school in the very\\nnear future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want to\\nstudy. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of\\nyears. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it won\\'t be\\nto Kansas.\\n\\n\"Right noew I\\'m discussing a promotion with my boss and district \\nmanager. It looks like I\\'ll train at the store I work at now for\\nabout 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when that\\'s done, I\\'ll \\nbasically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to \\nchose where i would like to manage. I\\'ve pretty much decided on either\\none of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldn\\'t it\\nbe fun to actually see each other more than once every few years??\\nWhat do you think abou that? I would like to know your opinion.\\n\\n\"This job would pretty much be temporary. But it is VERY GOOD pay\\nand any thye of management experience would look good on an application\\nor resume. The company is solid and treats it employees very well. Good\\nbenefits, bonuses & medical plans. Plus- after 1 year of full-time\\nservice, they will reimburse tuition. I do have school money waitng\\nfor me, but this will help, especially since I will probably end up \\npaying out of state tuition wherever I go.\\n\\n\"Chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. I \\nrespect your opinion. I\\'ve been completely lost for what to do for \\nsoooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really \\ngood. I do like my job although I\\'m about 99.9% sure that i want\\nto do more with my life than reatil management..but it IS something.\\nI don\\'t think earning about $20,000 a year for a 20 year old female\\nis too bad. \\n\\n\"Anyway, onto your career decisions. I\\'ll solve your problem right now,\\nMARRY ME...\\n\\n\"You can do your pilot thing-- I like to be by myself sometimes! Seriously\\n(or not as seriously)- do what will make you the happiest, worry about the\\nhome life later.\"\\n\\n***********\\n\\nOK, well I\\'m sure you see what has got me so uptight. What do you\\nthink she meant about the marraige thing?? \\n\\nI dream at night about marrying her, and then she mentions it in her\\nletter!!! I don\\'t know what to think??\\n\\nSince she wants to move to the Carolina\\'s should i search out a \\nBass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina???\\n\\nI always pick on those people who graduate from high school and\\nget married....but what does she mean??? \\n\\nI\\'ve had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that \\nI don\\'t date beacause 1) No time  2) Not that much $$ 3) that\\nmost college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  the\\nGreeks whic as a Christian I can\\'t support-----and here\\nshe says she doesn\\'t like the Greek thing either!!\\n\\nMaybe I\\'m so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am\\nso attracted to paying some real attention to me.\\n\\nI mean, what if she did move to NC...what would I do??? I\\'m\\nonly 19 and she 20....I\\'m only a Sophmore struggling through\\nclasses..\\n\\nI have prayed about this over the past year from time to time..\\nsaying, \"God if she is the right one, let the situation open up..\"\\n\\nCould this be my sign???\\n\\nI would do ANYTHING to get her to NC...here is some moree that makes \\nit worse..\\n\\nShould I call her?? I\\'m terrible over the phone. I don\\'t even like\\nto talk to my friends here for longer than 3 minutes.\\n\\nI mean, what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very\\naverage guy like me??\\n\\nI\\'m really confused....I would really appreciate any help i can get.\\n\\nThanx \\n\\nChris',\n",

Furthermore, the Church\\nhas always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say\\nthat I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free\\nwill.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also\\naffected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and\\nJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with\\nthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). \\nFor God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,\\nwho he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final\\nperserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those\\nwithout that grace can\\'t be saved, it just means that god foreknew their\\nobstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need\\nit, as they had freely chosen hell.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  ^^^^^^^^^^^\\nPeople who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own\\neffort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined\\nthem to become saints.

Thus, they were\\ndeserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and\\nsinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.\\n\\n\\nWell, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some\\nblessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),\\nfor those He can\\'t bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.

       "  '\\n\\nActually I don\\'t think there is any conflict if we really understand\\nwhat these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the \\nmeaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will\\ncome to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere \\nbelief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your \\nbelief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this \\nis what James means when he says that \"faith without works is dead\" \\nand, \"I will show you my faith by my works.\"  Remember James was \\nwriting to \"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\"  This \\nprobably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much \\nlater and wouldn\\'t understand the meaning of the original Greek.\\n(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he\\nintended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the\\npeople of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of\\nthe Greek.\\n\\nAnother key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul\\'s\\nstatements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul\\ncontrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the\\ngospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great\\nburden of Paul\\'s life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go\\nconvert a bunch of people, then the \"Judizers\" would come along and\\ntry to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf\\nActs chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being\\nsaved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood\\nof Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation\\nfor today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think\\n\"faithfulness\" today has a meaning closer to what the original\\nwriters intended.\\n\\n\\nI think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is\\nthat God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \"keep kosher\" to a\\nkosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters\\nof following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.\\n\\n\\nIn the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and \\nbe lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are \\nworse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in\\nthe parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in\\nthe one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that\\nthe price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.\\n\\n[I agree with you in general, including the fact that \"pistis\" has\\nsome of the force of \"faithful\".  However if you take that too far,\\nyou can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have\\nintended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say\\nthat we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we\\nare saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that\\'s not what you meant.\\n\\nI have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that\\ncompletely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I\\'d\\ncall a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and\\ncommitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic\\nchange.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show\\nthe new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any\\nChristian there had better be the basic change in orientation that\\nJesus calls being born again.',\n",
       "  'Another issue of importance.  Was the crucification the will of God or\\na tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.

He\\ndesperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If\\nthe crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this\\ncup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and\\nwomen have given their lives for their country or other noble causes.\\nIs Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification\\nwas NOT the will of GOD.  God\\'s will was that the Jewish people accept\\nJesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on\\nthe earth with Jesus as it\\'s head. (Just like the Jewish people\\nexpected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what\\nkind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different\\nworld.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.

I find it interesting that no other\\ncontemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain\\nbeing torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus\\' resurrection\\nis from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years\\nafter the supposed event.\\n\\n(2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no\\none knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely\\nexplanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers).\\nDon\\'t bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one\\ngospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make\\nup in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.

The problem was that this nephew would just\\ncollect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there.\\nThis would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop\\nGrosseteste was quite right in what he did!\\n\\nAnother example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages.\\nHe decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific\\nVision until the Last Judgement.

(415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\\n              \\nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \\nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\\nare also welcome.\\n\\nOTIS\\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \\nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \\nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \\nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\\ntougher to find.  If you can\\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \\nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \\nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \\n\\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \\n\\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\\'ll\\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \\ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \\nemailing).\\n\\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\\ncopies to:\\n\\nThe OTIS Project\\nc/o Ed Stastny\\nPO BX 241113\\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\\n\\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \\nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \\nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \\ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\\ndirectory where it\\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \\n \\nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\\ncontact me and we\\'ll arrange things.\\n\\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\\nThis is good for people who don\\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\\nJPG.  If you can\\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\\'d just rather\\nnot have to.\\n\\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\\ncan stand.  Even if you don\\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send\\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \\nget a slab-o-OTIS.\\n\\nAs of 04/21/93, we\\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \\nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION?\\n\\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \\non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \\nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \\n \\nIt would also be nice if you\\'d send me a note when you did post images\\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\\n\\nIt\\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\\ncase they\\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\\naddress or other information you\\'d like people to know.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHMMM?!\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\\nYour input is expected.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \\n \\t     (a sumerian deity) or it\\'s followers, be they pope, priest,\\n\\t     or ezine administrator.

OTIS\\n\\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\\n\\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \\n\\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \\n\\t     electronically.  If you don\\'t want your images distributed     \\n\\t     all-over, don\\'t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\\n\\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\\n\\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \\n\\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \\n\\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).

       "  'Heres a story of a Saint that people might like to read. I got it from\\na The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the\\neditor.\\n\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga\\n\\n    The Patron of Youth\\n\\n\\n    The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince\\n    Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured\\n    soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of\\n    Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and\\n    honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in\\n    the manner expected.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius\\' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from\\n    praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the\\n    life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this\\n    life.  As  Saint  Aloysius\\tgrew, he began to resemble his mother\\n    more than his father.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father\\'s\\n    soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he\\n    fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an\\n    example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).\\n\\n    About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received\\n    from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself\\n    became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and\\n    asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.\\n\\n    He wanted to share Our Lord\\'s suffering to\\tshow  his  reciprocal\\n    love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the\\n    finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of\\n    wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.\\n    While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his\\n    younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.\\n    Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well\\n    with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,\\n    intelligent and always had something interesting to say.\\n\\n\\n    Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint\\tIgna-\\n    tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)\\n    towards which Saint Aloysius\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  -12-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the\\n    marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.\\n\\n    After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in\\n    order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even\\n\\n    through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the\\n    religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.\\n\\n    The Marquis\\' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his\\n    son:  \"Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-\\n    ness?\" \"I will not, father,\" was the  in-evitable  reply.\\t\"Then\\n    leave from my sight and don\\'t return until you change your mind!\"\\n    With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to\\tpray:\\n    \"Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!\" He knelt down\\n    to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but\\n    this  time\\the was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This\\n    at last brought the proud man to his senses. \"The Lord wants him,\\n    the Lord can have him.\" He gave his consent for his son to become\\n    a Jesuit.\\n\\n    After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-\\n    ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and\\n    could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-\\n    sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare\\n    the dying for a holy death.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from\\tcarrying  and\\n    nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever\\n    and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul\\tto  the  Lord\\n    while gazing at a crucifix.\\n\\n    Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his\\n    humility, purity and confidence in prayer.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.\\n\\n    - Brendan Arthur\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of\\n    others as a sword is to a soldier\\n\\nGod Bless\\n\\nFrom Simon\\nLines:  106',\n",

       "  'Hi... I\\'m not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx\\nin advance)\\n\\nI want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There\\n\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\"   \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThanx in advance... Shaz....\\n\\n[I\\'m not sure quite what you mean by many different versions.\\nThe primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style\\nof the translation.  It\\'s pretty unusual to see significant\\ndifferences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying\\ntext.  That\\'s because before printing, manuscripts were copied by\\nhand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts\\naround that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the\\noriginal, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are\\ngenerally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are\\nsomething like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved,\\nbut with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don\\'t think there\\'s\\nmuch uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians\\nbelieve that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of\\ntranslating is free of error.  But I also don\\'t think there\\'s\\nenough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that\\nit has much practical effect.\\n\\nWhether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot\\ntopic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it\\n(though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details\\nthat don\\'t affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there\\nbeing multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in\\nall the versions.  I\\'m surprised to find a reference to this on the\\ntitle page though.  What version are you talking about?  I\\'ve been\\nreferring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get\\nreferenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been\\neditions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes\\neverything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into\\nsingle narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor\\nobjects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible\\nhas long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making\\neditions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions\\nthat are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from\\na variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine\\none of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all\\ninaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it\\'s not any edition\\nthat\\'s widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is.\\n(Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It\\'s been alleged that a few\\ntranslations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize\\ninconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there\\nare always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best,\\nI\\'m afraid.)',\n",

       "  'Archive-name: atheism/introduction\\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: introduction\\nLast-modified: 5 April 1993\\nVersion: 1.2\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\\n\\n                          An Introduction to Atheism\\n                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>\\n\\nThis article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst I\\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\\n\\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\\n\\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\\n\\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\\nmay not.\\n\\n\"What is atheism?\"\\n\\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\\natheism\".\\n\\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\\n\\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\\nflat-out denials.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn\\'t exist?\"\\n\\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\\n\\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\\n\\nThe term \\'agnosticism\\' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\\n\\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\\nsure whether God exists.\\n\\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\\nyou can work out someone\\'s philosophical point of view simply from the fact\\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\\n\\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\\nsure is that atheists don\\'t believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn\\'t\\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\\nabout the universe.\\n\\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it\\'s best to ask her.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\\nsee no evidence that God exists.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\\n\\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\\n\\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\\n\\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\\nmight be found, to show that it isn\\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search is\\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\\nprimes, because we can prove that they don\\'t exist.\\n\\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\\nthe time; they don\\'t believe in unicorns, even though they can\\'t conclusively\\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\\n\\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\\nprove that he doesn\\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\\n\\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\\nby any present-day religion exists.\\n\\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\\nGod are not really applicable.\\n\\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\\n\\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\\ndetectable.\\n\\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\\nimportance whether he exists or not.\\n\\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\\n\\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\\nfrom all the other things that don\\'t exist?\\n\\n\"OK, you may think there\\'s a philosophical justification for atheism, but\\n isn\\'t it still a religious belief?\"\\n\\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\\n\\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\\nthat it can\\'t be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\\n\\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn\\'t\\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\\nworship.\\n\\n[ It\\'s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\\n\\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\\n\\n\"OK, so it\\'s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\\n\\nFirstly, it\\'s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\\nactually believes in.\\n\\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\\n\\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\\n\\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\\n\\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn\\'t fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn\\'t really match, as\\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\\n\\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it\\'s anti-religious?\"\\n\\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\\n\\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\\n\\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\\n\\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\\nmany countries.\\n\\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\\n\\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\\n\\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\\nchurch and state should remain separate.\\n\\n\"But if you don\\'t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\\n surely that\\'s the same as state atheism?\"\\n\\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\\nnature.\\n\\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\\n\\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there\\'s no God, why do you care if people\\n pray?\"\\n\\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\\nthat those who don\\'t pray can\\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\\n\\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\\nmotives.\\n\\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\\n atheists?  Why aren\\'t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don\\'t\\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\\n\\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\\n\\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn\\'t worth shouting about in\\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it\\'s somewhat cheap, not to say\\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\\nof religious beliefs.\\n\\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\\nrather strange idea; it\\'s rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\\n\\n\"You said atheism isn\\'t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\\n one\\'s upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\\n\\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\\n\\nIt\\'s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\\nexpectations of others.\\n\\nOn the whole, we can\\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\\n\\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\\n\\nThey don\\'t believe in God.  That\\'s all there is to it.\\n\\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\\n\\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\\nappearance.\\n\\n\"Unexceptional? But aren\\'t atheists less moral than religious people?\"\\n\\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\\natheists are less moral as they don\\'t obey any God.  But usually when one\\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\\n\\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\\nof self-preservation.\\n\\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\\nwhat happens to others?  They don\\'t know, they simply are that way.\\n\\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\\nactions.  For example:\\n\\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\\n\\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\\n\\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\\n   before salvation; 5% after.\\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\\n\\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\\nbehaviour.\\n\\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\\n\\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\\n\\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world \\'ought\\' to work, rather\\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\\n\\n\"Then aren\\'t atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\\n\\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\\nwith what they observed around them.\\n\\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\\n\\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\\nindividual\\'s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\\nchoice that person can honestly make.\\n\\n\"But don\\'t atheists want to believe in God?\"\\n\\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\\n\\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\\n\\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\\n\\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\\n\\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren\\'t looking properly\"\\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\\n\\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\\nfutile.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\\n\\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\\n\\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\\nthat has a \"meaning\".\\n\\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\\n\\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\\n\\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\\n\\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\\n\\nIn the end, it\\'s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\\'s just\\nhard luck.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\\n\\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\\n\\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\\n\\nThousands of years of religious belief haven\\'t resulted in any good proof of\\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\\n\\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don\\'t the same arguments\\n apply?\"\\n\\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\\n\\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\\nbut to everyone else.\\n\\n\"What sort of harm?\"\\n\\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\\'s not\\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\\n\\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\\n\\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church\\'s opposition to birth control -- and\\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\\n\\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\\nreligion.\\n\\n\"Those weren\\'t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\\n sort of excuse.\"\\n\\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it\\'s hard\\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who\\'s a REAL\\nChristian and who isn\\'t, when even the major Christian churches like the\\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can\\'t decide amongst themselves?\\n\\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can\\'t be\\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn\\'t he have\\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\\naren\\'t a perversion of what your God intended?\\n\\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\\nChristian.\\n\\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\\n\\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\\ndon\\'t exist, but that doesn\\'t make it unlikely that they are myths.\\n\\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\\n\\n\"Well, if atheism\\'s so great, why are there so many theists?\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\\npurposes as well.\\n\\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\\n something?\"\\n\\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it\\'s\\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\\n\\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it\\'s\\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\\n\\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\\n that God exists?\"\\n\\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\\n\\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\\n\\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\\n nothing?\"\\n\\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\\n\\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\\nother memes.\\n\\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\\n\\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\\nfew of them; don\\'t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\\nreligions.\\n\\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\\n\\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\\n\\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it\\'s up to you to\\n   find it.\\n\\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\\n\\n   Make the most of your life, as it\\'s probably the only one you\\'ll have.\\n\\n   It\\'s no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\\n   yourself.\\n\\n   Just because something\\'s popular doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good.\\n\\n   If you must assume something, assume something it\\'s easy to test.\\n\\n   Don\\'t believe things just because you want them to be true.\\n\\nand finally (and most importantly):\\n\\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.2\\n\\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\\n=q2V5\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----',\n",

       "  \"Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...\\n\\nI'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I\\ncan help a little.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

       "  '\\nThe existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not\\nmean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds.\\nThere is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I\\ndid not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual over\\nanother as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not\\npreclude that the development of that individual into what he is in\\nthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.\\n\\nI do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view\\nof an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that\\nbefalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater\\nlaw in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the\\nultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of\\nChrist can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that\\nwas completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the\\nflesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental\\nconcepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized\\nand mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus\\nChrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.\\nTheir teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the\\ncontinuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).\\nMore important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,\\nthe ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate\\nresurrection and judgement on the Last Day.\\n\\nThere is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the\\ntenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.\\nClearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma\\nor that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a\\nnew impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not\\nrefute the disciples\\' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of\\ncourse, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only\\none of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man\\nhimself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his\\nparents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at\\nall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of\\nChrist\\'s answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.\\n\\nThere is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John\\nthe Baptist,\\n\\n   \"If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.\"\\n\\nThis also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching\\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to\\nthe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did\\nnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\"If\\nyou care to accept it\").  So I took care to point out, not that the\\nBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and\\nthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes\\nunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I\\npointedly used \"repeated earth lives\" to distinguish a little from the\\noriental doctrines usually associated with the word \"reincarnation\".\\nThe phrase is Rudolf Steiner\\'s (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too\\nthat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely\\nfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth\\ncenturies, the most important expression of it being Lessing\\'s \"The\\nEducation of the Human Race\".\\n\\nTo return to your original point, Paul\\'s statement about Jacob and\\nEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.\\nAnd both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the\\nincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus\\nChrist, in my view.',\n",
       "  ' \\n: [ The discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all?  ]\\n \\n: One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate \\n: (at least to this layman\\'s mind) there must be a causal event.  No\\n: reasonable alternative exists.\\n\\nI would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; \\ncauses precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be\\nan answer to \"how\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from \\n\"nothing\", science has some good candidates for an answer.\\n\\nI have always wondered why Christians use the \"There are questions\\nscience (or atheism) cannot answer\" argument; I hope this is the\\nappropriate group to ask this question.\\n\\nThe most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the\\nuniverse exist, or anything, for that matter?\\n\\nI think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\\n\\n1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\\n\\nand\\n\\n2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\\n\\nIt is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\\nis it a meaningful question, after all?\\n\\nI would say it isn\\'t. Consider the following:\\n\\nA die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt\\none\\'s very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else -\\nI cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me -\\ncan I ever be sure I exist?\\n\\nHowever, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone\\ninsert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )\\n\\nA being that does not exist cannot doubt one\\'s existence.\\nA being that does exist can doubt one\\'s existence, but this would be\\npointless - the being would exist anyway.\\n\\nLet us return to the original question: why? A being that does not\\nexist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being\\nis not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let\\nus assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity\\npostulate). The question \"why anything exists\" can be countered by\\ndemanding answer to a question \"why there is nothing in nothingness,\\nor in non-existence\". Actually, both questions turn out to be\\ndevoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don\\'t exist\\ndon\\'t exist. Tautology at its best.\\n\\nI seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\\n\\nSome Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\\nHimself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\\nanswer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\\nactually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\\nthem. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\\n\\nAnother answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\\nThis sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\\nHimself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\\nit can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\\nexisted. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\\nThis argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists,\\nand from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence.\\nI think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.\\n\\nThe best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\\nof understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\\naccept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\\n\\nThe second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing?\\nbelongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the\\nquestion can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have\\nsuggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge\\nfrom vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent\\nHawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe,\\nWorld Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more\\nappropriate for discussions like this.\\n \\n: As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn\\'t\\n: true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\\n\\nThis is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\\nnot why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\\nquestions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\\nsupernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\\nas appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\\n \\n: I believe the \"genetic code\" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,\\n: but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, \\n: reproducing life, *ever*.  (I\\'ve never been much of a prophet, though. I\\n: can\\'t even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).

       "  '[With Frank\\'s permission, I have added some information here (and in\\none case changed the order of his contributions) in order to clarify\\nthe historical relationship of the views.  My comments are based\\nprimarily on William Rusch\\'s historical summary in \"The Trinitarian\\nControversy\", Fortress.  I\\'m going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]\\n\\nMAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY\\n \\n[SECOND CENTURY\\n\\nThe writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much\\nof the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides,\\nAthenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the\\n\"Apologists\".  Their theology has often been described as \"Logos\\ntheology\".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less\\na two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the\\nFather, as his mind or thought.  This \"immanent Word\" became\\n\"expressed\" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus.\\nThus Jesus\\' full distinction from the Father only became visible in\\nhistory, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity.\\nRusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the\\nfinal orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated,\\nbecause it did not have the technical language to properly deal with\\nthe eternal plurality in the Godhead.\\n\\nIrenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he\\nwas uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as\\none personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible\\nexcept through his process of self-revelation (the \"economy\").  The\\ndistinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized\\nthe Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus\\' views should\\nprobably be called \"economic trinitarianism\", though that term is\\nnormally used (as below) to refer to later developments.\\n\\n\\nTHIRD CENTURY\\n\\n--clh]\\n\\nDynamic Monarchianism\\n \\nSource: Theodotus\\nAdherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature\\nand oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are\\nconsubstantial with the Father\\'s divine essence only as impersonal attributes.\\nThe divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict\\nsense of the word.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable\\nimpossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The\\n\\'diversity\\' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the\\nwork of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to\\na hypostatic union.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and\\nwithout beginning or end.\\n Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in\\na unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.\\n Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality\\nis ascribed to the Holy Spirit.\\nCriticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation\\nconcerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the\\nHoly Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical\\ndoctrine of salvation.\\n[In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism\\nat all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen\\nas simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the\\nChurch.  --clh]\\n\\n \\nModalistic Monarchianism\\n \\nSource: Praxeas\\nAdherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals\\n(Jesus Only)\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is\\nqualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This\\nessence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\nThey are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The\\nthree names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous\\nand confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God\\'s modalistic manifesting\\nof himself. The paradox of a subsisting \"three in oneness\" is refuted by\\nrecognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different\\nnames and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of\\nthe only unique and unitary God\\n Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another\\nmode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God\\nmanifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).\\n Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the\\none God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of\\nregeneration and sanctification.\\nCriticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian\\ndeficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its\\nconcept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such\\nsimultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ\\'s baptism.\\n[Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are\\nactually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his\\nfollowers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme.\\nSabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic\\nTrinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately,\\ninformation about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there\\nseems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]\\n \\n[I\\'ve moved the following description to be with the other\\nthird-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]\\n\\n\"Economic\" Trinitarianism\\n \\nSource: Hippolytus, Tertullian\\nAdherents: Various \"neo-economic\" Trinitarians\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father,\\nSon, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical,\\nindivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially\\ncomprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated\\nby means of such terms as \"distinction\" and \"distribution\" dispelling\\neffectively the notion of separateness or division.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\nThe equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in\\nobservation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the\\nGodhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this\\nambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication.\\nCriticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the\\nrelational aspect of the Trinity.\\n[Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as\\nmentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in\\nthe various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they\\ndid say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow\\npresent in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of\\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in\\nsubstance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially\\northodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]\\n\\n[Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted\\nto apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms\\nof the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a\\nmediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality\\nof creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is \"eternally\\ngenerated\".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is\\neternal.  It cannot be said that \"there was once when he was not\" (a\\nphrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son\\nis intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described\\nas separate \"hypostases\", though this may not have quite the meaning\\nof separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is\\none of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may\\nhave used the term homoousios (\"of the same substance\").  The Holy\\nSpirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father\\nthrough the Son.  Origen\\'s intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but\\nhe pushes things in the direction of separateness.\\n\\n\\nFOURTH CENTURY\\n\\n--clh]\\n\\nSubordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]\\n \\nSource: Arius\\nMajor Adherents: Modern Jehovah\\'s Witnesses, and several other lesser known\\ncults\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The inherent oneness of God\\'s nature is properly\\nidentifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet\\nentities who do not share the divine essence.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the\\nconcept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. \"Threeness in oneness\" is self-\\ncontradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.\\n Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated,\\nhe is not of the divine essence.\\n Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed\\nas an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him.\\nCriticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting\\nthe deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise\\nasserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ,\\nand the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology.\\n[Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully\\nhuman either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this\\nview from adoptionism.  --clh]\\n \\nOrthodox Trinitarianism\\n \\nSource: Athanasius\\nAdherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas\\nAquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: God\\'s being is perfectly unified and simplex: of\\none essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy\\nSpirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co-\\neternal.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in\\nthree modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists \"undivided in\\ndivided persons.\" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation\\nin function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\nIn its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son,\\nand Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both\\nthe divine essence and function.\\nCriticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in\\nhuman language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the\\nineffable mystery of \"three in oneness.\"\\n[At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all\\nof which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which\\nare somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond\\nto Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen\\'s thought a bit\\ntoo far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general\\nthe East tended to take an approach based on Origen\\'s, and it was hard\\nto get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was\\nbased on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and\\nGregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three,\\nthey show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one\\nmust think of them as being a single God.

       "  'In an earlier article, I explained that what many people find arrogant about\\nChristians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their\\nbeliefs and doctrines.  That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have\\nmade any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying\\nthat they are infallible.\\n\\nImpicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will\\nprobably agree.\\n\\nIn short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any\\npart of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning,\\nthen those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved,\\nthere is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing \"There\\nis no way out of the loop.\"\\n\\n\\nSomeone called `REXLEX\\' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but\\nhe did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase\\nSartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument\\nleads to relativism.\\n\\nAs I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false\\nbecause you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because\\n\\n\\nHowever, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX\\' has\\nwritten does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does\\nnot like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThere were two sentences in `REXLEX\\'s post that seemed relevant to the\\npoint at hand:\\n\\n\\nI do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I\\nhave, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don\\'t claim to\\nbe infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I\\ndo claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.\\n\\nHowever, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about\\nthem, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier\\narticle.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted\\nin very limited circumstances.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut how far does that get you?  Once God\\'s revelation stops, and your own\\nreasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s suppose that our modern Bible translations include a\\nperfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said,\\nexactly, \"This is my body.\"\\n\\nWe\\'ll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely\\ntrue.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\\n\\nAt the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the\\npossibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do\\nnot have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of\\nTran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn\\'t say.  We interpret this passage\\nusing our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know\\nthat our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This\\nis something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)\\n\\nWhy should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be\\nfallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?\\n\\nSo, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is\\nthat Jesus said \"This is my body.\"  Beyond that, once we start making up\\ndoctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we\\nget into trouble.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain\\nof.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\\ncannot be certain.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know\\nthat human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not\\nbelieve we are infallible, any more than we do.\\n\\nWhen Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead\\nthem astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non-\\nChristians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is\\nhardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you\\nare either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\\nto cover them up.\\n\\nI think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what\\nthings we are only \"very confident\" of.  For example, we might say that we\\nknow our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But\\nother things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical\\nthinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are\\nvery confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.\\n\\nBut, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting\\nas if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.\\n\\n *\\n\\n`REXLEX\\' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by\\nFrancis Schaeffer.  I didn\\'t think very highly of it, but I think that\\nMr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody\\nelse might like it, though, so don\\'t let my opinion stop you from reading it.\\n\\nIf someone is interested in my opinion, I\\'d suggest _On Certainty_, by\\nLudwig Wittgenstein.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\n\\n\\n  Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since\\nrespect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This\\ndoesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in\\nthe Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.\\n\\n  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should\\naddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like\\nit or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,\\nand isn't.  \\n  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has\\nforgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we\\nhave something to learn from the pagan movement.\\n  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of\\noppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to\\nlive in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ \\ncould have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great\\ndeal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the \\nmale-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have\\nhad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.\\n  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great\\nramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings\\nand our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long\\ntradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress\\nand deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human\\nexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  \\nChristianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism\\nis an attractive option.\\n  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)\\nshould be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of\\nsexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated\\nsexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\n",

Some say that if the two have\\n: publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and\\n: are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective\\n: qualifier) they are married/joined in God\\'s sight.\\n\\nThe way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*\\nmarried, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.\\n\\ne.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall\\nleave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh\\'\\'\\n(Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).\\n\\nIf you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the\\nphraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife\\'\\'. This\\nimplies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the\\npoint of intercourse.\\n\\nCompare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary\\nwas pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were\\n*betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which\\nrequired a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary\\nand Joseph went to bed together.\\n\\nCompare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is\\ndescribed as the ``bride\\'\\' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes \\nplace when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with\\nJesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will\\ntake place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse,\\nbecause it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.\\n\\nIn summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is\\nnot marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the\\npoint when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don\\'t mean to demean the\\ncivil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don\\'t mean to be too pedantic.)\\nHistorically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a\\nmarriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since\\nNapoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I\\'m ready to be\\ncorrected on that point!)\\n\\nThis view obviously raises some questions:\\n\\nWhat about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering\\nmarriage. Are those people also ``married\\'\\'?\\n\\nIf it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary\\nto be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours\\nthe laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep\\ntogether though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God-\\nhonouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before\\nactually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and\\nalso to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive\\nto declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)\\n\\n-- \\n\\n-----\\nMichael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)',\n",

SO, he applied the same logoic as he had\\n##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he\\n##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable\\n##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but,\\n##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he\\n##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to\\n##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after\\n##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by\\n##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that,\\n##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to\\n##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the\\n##Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in\\n##the Traditions.

       "  'The ONLY unity I\\'ve found which is true is when all parties involved are\\ndisciples.  I came out of a church in which even the different\\ncongregations were always competing and arguing about which one was\\nbetter and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything\\ninto practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I\\'ve\\nfound that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they\\nare just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in\\nJanuary when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this\\nretreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even\\nthe people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple\\nthe previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One\\nof the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only\\none area in which disciples stand out from \"Christians\".  Also, another\\npart of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I\\'ve also been a part of\\nsome \"Christian\" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between\\nchurches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of\\nconviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be\\nunified, they didn\\'t care about the truth but delighted in getting along\\ntogether.\\n\\nCreeds?  What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly\\nbetter?\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going\\nto be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those\\nwho teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion\\nand belief.  However, Scripture states:  \\n   In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your\\nmeetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when\\nyou come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some\\nextent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to\\nshow which of you have God\\'s approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).\\n\\nHow will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but\\nbefore that, there are these qualities:\\n   devotion to the apostles teaching\\n   fellowship\\n   communion\\n   filling with awe for God\\n   all having everything in common.\\n   glad and sincere hearts\\n   praising God\\n   enjoying the favor of the people\\nAll these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who\\nhave these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, \"a man full of\\nfaith and of the Holy Spirit\" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts\\n7:54-60).  \\n\\n\\nOne can say that a church is the true church only if that church is\\nperfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I\\nhave yet to find that, but the closest one I\\'ve found is the Boston\\nChurch of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors\\npointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I\\'ve seen which is\\ntotally sold out to God.\\n\\nAs for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may\\nnever occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the\\n\"true one\", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are\\ndisciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they\\nwill not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I\\'ve heard\\nnumerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there\\nthat are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them\\nany less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they\\'ve ever run\\ninto someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement.\\nI know I haven\\'t.\\n\\nI must warn that this sounds cliquey to me.  A clique is a group which\\nruns around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems\\nin fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is\\nsomething \"correct\" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of\\nthe churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of\\npeople who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational\\nheads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of\\nthe committees and seldom were voted out of office without another\\noffice being \"opened up\" so that they would have to step right back in.\\nTheir degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he\\nnearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he\\nwould\\'ve since they still have no clue about what it means to be a\\ndisciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be\\nbroken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division\\nwithin.  There\\'s enough division without.\\n',\n",

Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur\\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\\nyou.  The Qur\\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\\nonly an idiot would think so.\\n\\nDo you see my point?\\n\\n\\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \\ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\\n\\n\\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\\nIslam => lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur\\'an or not.\\n\\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur\\'an\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.

If\\nMoslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill\\nthem.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions.\\nThere are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under\\nattack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are\\nliving together peacefully.\\n\\nThe precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two\\ndifferent things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into\\nCanaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have\\npromised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be\\na holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those\\nattacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be\\ndefeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in\\nJoshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was\\npossible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once\\nthat was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were\\nexpected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of\\nagreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted\\nBosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior\\nwould have disqualified this from being a holy war.\\n\\nThe other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by\\nAssyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel\\nfor her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a\\njudgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay\\nof the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because\\nillness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God\\nfor good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't\\njustify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that\\nin attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as\\n*unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's\\npeople, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were\\nactually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action.\\nFurthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are\\njudgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through\\nhis prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to\\nBosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting,\\nI am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that\\ndoesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from\\njudgement.\",\n",

This is in response to a question about\\nthe Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification\\nup to our Catholic readers.  --clh]\\n\\nThere is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the\\nmention of Mary\\'s _blessedness_/full of grace in the \"Annunciation\" by\\nAngel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28\\n\\n And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto\\n a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a\\n man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin\\'s\\n name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\"Hail,\\n thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed\\n art thou among women.\"_\\n\\nNow, now, hold that line of thought - \"the Lord is with Mary &\\nblessed art thou among women\" - while you read on....\\n\\nIn the book, \"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of\\nDevotion to Mary\" by Peter Lappin:\\n\\nThe _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated\\nthan the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible\\nthat the feast of _Mary\\'s Conception_ under the title \"The Conception\\nof Saint Anne\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of\\na woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,\\njust as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in\\nemphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle\\nof grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary\\nis the incorruptible timber \"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_\\nof Christ\\'s sinless body\"; she is \"God\\'s Eden, in whom there is\\nno tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\"  Her perfect\\nbeauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her\\npurity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,\\nshe was hailed as \"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,\\nspotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from\\namong thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\".\\n...\\nAt the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,\\nJohn Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a \\ngreater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all\\nsin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.\\n...\\n\\nNow let\\'s go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.\\nFrom \"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\" by John A. Hardon:\\n\\nBaptism -\\nConcupiscence Remains after Baptism.\\nConcupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized\\nbut since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to\\ninjure those who do not consent and who by the grace of\\nChrist Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).\\n\\nOriginal gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:\\nIn the light of the foregoing, we see that our first\\nparents were originally gifted three times over:\\n-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the\\n power to think and to choose freely.\\n-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality\\n and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.\\n-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,\\n the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding\\n title to enter heaven.\\nBy their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and\\npreternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without\\nlosing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose\\nfreely.\\n\\nBaptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam\\'s\\nsin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts\\nbut gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our\\nbodies on the last day...\\n\\nGoing back to _Immaculate Conception_\\n(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other\\nbooks but it may be another contribution to the \\'puzzle\\'):\\n\\nGiven the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a\\nnon-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born \\nAND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary\\'s birth but\\nSTILL, the Angel Gabriel\\'s greetings was:\\n\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.\\nBlessed art thou amongst women\".\\n\\nEven Mary was confused about this greeting.\\n\\nMary could very well have possessed all of the\\n_treefold original gifts above_ given to our first\\nparents (Adam and Eve before their sin):\\n    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)\\n    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)\\n    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would\\n                definitely want to be with those He\\n                has made _blessed_)\\n    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)\\n\\nAt the conception, God made Mary _full of grace\\nand blessed_ as the \\'tabernacle\\' for the coming body\\nof Christ and so,\\n\\nImmaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still\\nhas maintained her Immaculate Heart.

Service shall be\\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\\n \\nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\\nyouth membership.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\\n \\nProgram materials are in development at this time.

We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed\\nout, to comprehend God\\'s revelation of himself in the Bible.\\nBut reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe\\nthe Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For \"the sinful\\nmind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God\\'s law,\\n*nor can it do so*\"  (Romans 8:7).\\n\\nLuther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation\\n(\"Sola Scriptura\"), but accepted the necessity of the use\\nof reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation.\\nYet Luther also said, regarding baptism, \"But mad reason\\nrushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like\\nthe works which we do, regards it as worthless.\" (Large\\nCatechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more\\ncomplicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many \\npeople would describe as an `absolutist\\'.  I\\'ve seen him \\ndescribed as a `take no prisoners\\' theologian.\\n\\nWe might conclude, given these observations, that Luther\\nwas inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have\\ncome to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to\\nrecall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt\\ncompelled to defend himself and the apostles against\\na charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians\\nought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others) \\nas mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who\\nexamined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul\\nsaid was true (Acts 17:11).\\n\\nThe basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many\\nothers preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy\\nSpirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that\\nguides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the\\ntruth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the\\nmessage that \"I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead\" but\\nrather \"I know that my redeemer lives!\"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian\\ndoes not side with Pilate in saying \"What is truth?\" but rather\\nfollows Christ, who said, \"In fact, for this reason I was born, and\\nfor this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on\\nthe side of truth listens to me\" (John 18:37).\\n\\nWe can know the truth because God has promised us that we can\\nknow the truth.  Jesus said, \"If you hold to my teachings,\\nyou are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth,\\nand the truth will set you free\" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs\\nurge us \"Buy the truth, and do not sell it.\" (Pr 23:23).\\nThe Psalmist prayed \"Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth\"\\n(Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth\\nwas in fact `in his mouth\\'.  \\n\\nYet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth\\nis motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the\\ntruth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the \\nSpirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready\\nto be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther\\ndid, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly\\ntrust in God\\'s promise of truth, just as we trust in his\\npromise of forgiveness.\\n\\nREXLEX> It is only because of God\\'s own revelation that we can be \\nREXLEX> absolute about a thing.\\n\\nDarren> But how far does that get you?  Once God\\'s revelation stops,\\nDarren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\\n\\nI agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings\\nof Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such\\nreasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw\\nthe line of distinction more `reasonably\\'  :-)  and less `academically\\'\\nthan you would.\\n\\nDarren> For example, let\\'s suppose that our modern Bible translations\\nDarren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper,\\nDarren> and that Jesus said, exactly, \"This is my body.\"\\n\\nDarren> We\\'ll presume that what he said was totally without error and\\nDarren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\\n\\nDarren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start\\nDarren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean\\nDarren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he\\nDarren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con-\\nDarren> substantiation?  He didn\\'t say. \\n\\nDarren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement\\nabout the Lord\\'s supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say\\nthat if Jesus said, \"This is my body,\" then that is what we\\nshould believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because\\nthey are not taught in Scripture.\\n\\nRecall that Jesus\\' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also\\nhave Paul\\'s words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to\\nus, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, \"For\\nwhenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the\\nLord\\'s death until he comes.\"  By these words we should believe that\\nthe bread that we eat in the Lord\\'s Supper really is bread (as well as\\nthe Lord\\'s body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove*\\nthat tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that\\nPaul spoke metaphorically of the Lord\\'s body as bread, simply because\\nthat is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is\\nfound nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary\\nreason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can\\nprove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.\\n\\n[side remark]\\nI\\'ve been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is\\ncon-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told\\nme this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this\\nis used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels\\nto compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord\\'s\\nSupper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching\\n\"real presence\" because that was the traditional teaching of \\nthe church.\\n[end side remark]\\n\\nDarren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning\\nDarren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we\\nDarren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe\\nDarren> that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when\\nDarren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too\\nDarren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\\nDarren> to cover them up.\\n\\nThis is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations\\nin their witnessing.

       "  'Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in\\ngeneral and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around\\n1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous\\nactivities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all\\nthat.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.\\n\\nJoe Buehler\\n\\n...\\n\\nSchism and Disobedience\\n\\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a\\nrefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the\\nChurch united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever\\nthe subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he\\nmust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to\\nthe Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of\\njurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it\\nclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of\\ndisobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the\\nbeginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American\\nbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.\\n\\nThe distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in\\nthe article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de\\nTheologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is\\ncertainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism\\nand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father\\nCongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence\\nof legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther\\'s rejection\\nof the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a\\ndecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not\\nconstitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia\\nexplains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to\\nintend \"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\"  It\\nadds that \"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this\\ncharacter it must include besides the transgression of the command of\\nthe superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\"Not only\\ndoes Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,\\nbut he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope\\'s authority and\\nhis intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made\\nhis attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \"We pray\\nfor the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations\\nlast June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II\\nthe legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don\\'t even say that he\\nis a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor\\nheresy.\"\\n\\n...\\n\\nIntrinsically Schismatic?\\n\\nThe principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in\\nschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is\\nan intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a\\nconsecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is\\nnot true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it\\nwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917\\nCode of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see\\nCanon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to\\nexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic\\nchurch in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops\\ndiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre\\nas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,\\nthat is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the\\nillicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise\\nan apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the\\nbishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of\\njurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of\\nensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and\\nalso to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way\\nthe gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of\\nbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the\\nordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the\\nprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman\\nPontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the\\nChurch could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in\\nresponse.\\n\\nIt appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop\\'s critics\\nthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican\\nhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not\\nso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of\\nCanon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled\\n\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The\\nfirst part deals with \"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the\\nChurch\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon\\n1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together\\nwith apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses\\nagainst the unity of the Church.\\n\\nBut the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this\\ncanon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against\\nreligion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his\\nexcommunication comes from the third section of \"Penalties for\\nSpecific Offenses\" which is entitled \"Usurpation of Ecclesial\\nFunctions and Offenses in their Exercise\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum\\nUsurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is\\nCanon 1382, which reads: \"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and\\nthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a\\npontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)\\nexcommunication reserved to the Holy See.\"\\n\\nThe scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense\\nof schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable\\nsmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly\\njustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate\\nparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had\\nbeen convicted of first degree murder.\\n\\nI must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion\\nof laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers\\nwithout the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated\\nthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father\\nPatrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut\\nCatholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs\\nactuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not\\nexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical\\nfunction. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which\\nconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the\\nillicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of\\nthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a\\nparallel Church.\\n\\nCardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the\\nAuthentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations\\nin the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to\\n\\n    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not\\n    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with\\n    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses\\n    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are\\n    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a\\n    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the\\n    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the\\n    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh\\n    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated\\n    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because\\n    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.\\n\\n....\\n\\nIt is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating\\nbishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least\\nintent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and\\nwill never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that\\nthe the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,\\nand that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to\\nconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon\\nLaw provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that\\nthe future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these\\nconsecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it\\ncould not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred\\nexcommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates\\nas Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot\\nexpect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a\\ngreat and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to\\nthe service of the Church and the salvation of souls.\\n\\nDr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce\\nAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he\\nknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no\\ngreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and\\nthe Holy See during the Archbishop\\'s lifetime. A quotation from a\\nstatement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February\\n1989 Remnant merits careful study:',\n",

       "  'In <Apr.10.05.30.16.1993.14313@athos.rutgers.edu>\\n\\n\\n[ . . . ]\\n\\nHaving lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as the\\nCatholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting\\ntheir rosary beads during Mass, I find this comment interesting.  There\\nis a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts\\nwithout active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really\\nbeautiful way to hear the Passion is it\\'s being chanted by three\\ndeacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants\\nin the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.\\nThis is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion\\nthat John would prefer.\\n\\nBut there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations.\\nEach pastor makes his own decisions (it isn\\'t a church-wide conspiracy\\nagainst participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial\\nblessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already\\ngetting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they\\nshould not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the\\norchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation\\nin the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation\\n--- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be\\nnecessary to go with the briefer options just to \"get \\'em in and get \\'em\\nout\".\\n\\nEach parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to\\ntheir geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish\\nin the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy\\ncloser to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow\\nparishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors\\ngenerally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though\\nyou probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly\\nto the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn\\'t follow\\nthe continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no\\nsingle one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated\\nequilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them,\\nthen the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering\\nthe names of the evolutionary theories.}',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nThe Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13).\\n And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is\\njust to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the\\ninevitablity of the sucess of God\\'s plan, and this is especially hard to\\ngrasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are\\ndoing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it\\nmust be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to\\nthe final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is\\npossible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the\\neyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts\\nnow rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing\\npeople for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and\\nAnnias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His\\nplan might be accomplished.\\n    But don\\'t forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to\\nexecute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to\\nfulfill the chorus of \"Let his blood be upon our hands\" of the crowd in\\nJersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,\\nwhich was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish\\nother nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. \\nDon\\'t you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, \"Mene, mene,\\ntekel, peres?\"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God\\'s\\njustice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians\\nas their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the\\nextirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. \\nThe Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and\\nthe Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go\\non with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is\\nquite clear.\\nTwo things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to\\nquestion why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,\\nHe made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans\\n9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of\\nJesus Christ is as follows: \"Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at\\nhand.\"  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - \"Let\\nthe dead bury the dead, come, follow me.\"  There is not an infinite\\namount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to\\nfollow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, \"well, alright,\\nyou can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your\\nplans.\"  He said \"Follow me.\"  His message is NOT \"I\\'m just a sweety-pie\\nwho would never hurt a fly, you\\'ve got all the time in the world, and\\nDivine Judgement, that\\'s only a fairy tale.\"  \"Our great God and Savior\"\\nJesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the\\nworld.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be\\nquestioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.',\n",

       "  'Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial\\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\\n     when questioning? \\n\\nI\\'ve often found it to be the case that the theist\\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I\\'ve\\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\\n     search for their god.\\n     \\nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\\n     was behind the universe\\'s existence.  I\\'ve\\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\\n     versa, I\\'ve known Christians who were once\\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I\\'ve even known\\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\\n     their transition from one faith to another,\\n     they\\'ve kept this belief in some form of higher\\n     \"being.\"  Why?\\n     \\nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\\n     the Torah, the Qur\\'an, & etc.  He is told\\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\\n     He is also told that to question this (as\\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\\n     ture\\'s truth is to damn one\\'s soul to Hell.\\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\\n     matter of course.\\n     \\nBut it doesn\\'t stop there.  Once the child is able\\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \\n     superstitions he\\'s been taught are nearly\\n     impossible to remove.\\n     \\nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\\n     & etc.).

Below is a very short\\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\\n\\n================================================================\\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\\n\\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.

Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\\n\\n   If you don\\'t find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn\\'t set up\\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\\n   problem.\\n\\n3.

(Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.

       "  'Hi there netters,\\nI have a question I would very much like to see some discussion on:\\nIs there such a thing as a \\'justifible\\' war? \\n\\nWhat I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: \"All war  \\nis wrong\", or \"Some war is justifiable\". \\n\\nTo get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the  \\nquestion. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New  \\nZealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of  \\nit, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).  \\nThrough this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved  \\nin the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation  \\nhardware as the very best a \\'real\\' flyer could ask for. My favourite  \\ncomputer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both  \\npast and present. \\n\\nI became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all  \\nmilitary activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition  \\nto God\\'s commandments to love one another, especially one\\'s enemies.\\n\\nDuring the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to  \\nthe reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation  \\ntechnology I so admire - The F117A \\'Stealh\\' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16  \\nstrike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy  \\nsimulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam\\'s  \\nbio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his  \\nMig\\'s in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful  \\ngame. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.  \\nOne only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact  \\nof war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a  \\npilot is simply a \\'target\\'. Dead civilians are \\'collateral damage\\'. These  \\neuphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose  \\nsupport are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to  \\nlook at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.\\n\\nNow we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and  \\nthe prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in  \\nthe former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of  \\nSarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry \\'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,  \\nhas caused me to rethink where I stand on \\'justifiable\\' war.\\n\\nI will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say  \\n- Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut  \\nreactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality  \\nhistory brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for  \\nmy reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I  \\nam working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.\\n\\n1. The Second World War\\n\\t- Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.\\n\\t- Massive civilian casualties on both sides \\n\\t\\t- Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki\\n\\t- Probably justifiable.\\n\\n2. Korean war\\n\\t- Political expansionism by North Korea, basically\\n\\t  communism vs. capitalism.\\n\\t- Probably not justifiable.\\n\\n3. Vietnam\\n\\t- As above, worsened by US involvement.\\n\\n4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.\\n\\t- Genocide by Khmer Rouge.\\n\\t- Probably justifiable.\\n\\n5. Iraq (Desert Storm)\\n\\t- Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply\\n\\t- Other factors such as genocide.\\n\\t- Not sure, but probably justifiable\\n\\n6. A future involvement in Bosnia\\n\\t- Genocide - so called \\'Ethnic Cleansing\\'\\n\\t- Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.\\n\\t- Probably justifiable\\n\\n7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,  \\nsomewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya  \\nor Israel.\\n\\t- My feelings in this are simple\\n\\t- Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent\\n\\t- I love the New Zealand government\\'s stand on banning all nuclear\\n\\t  armed or powered warships from NZ port.\\n\\t- Never justifiable.\\n\\nThese are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused.

       "  '\\n\\nWell, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes.\\n \\nYou have to be very careful about what you mean by \"question authority\".\\nTaken literally, it is nonsense. That which is authoratative is authoratative,\\nand to say \"I question to word of this authority\" is ridiculous. If it is \\nopen to question, it isn\\'t an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly\\nreasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase\\nhere should be \"authenticate authority.\" Once you have authenticated\\nyour authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as\\nan authority. \\n\\nThe difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You \\ncan perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency\\nin what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of\\ndiscourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in\\ninself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and \\nother that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.)\\nI cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, \\nbecause if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don\\'t need an \\nauthority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which\\nI cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must\\ndo it by some means other than by examining its teachings. \\n\\nIn practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don\\'t\\nhave time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist\\nworing today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts\\nof knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to \\nverify for himself.\\n\\nIn spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source \\nofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am\\na Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem\\nthe strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for\\nbelief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).\\n\\nThe atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a\\nreasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty.\\nIf you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of\\nevery receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly\\nchange. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific. \\n\\nTo demand scintific or rational proof of God\\'s existence, is to deny\\nGod\\'s existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very\\nnature, prove anything.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through\\nhistory.  The Greek, for example, could say, \"better a beggar in the land\\nof the living than a king in the land of the dead.\" (Iliad, I think).\\n\\nThe question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is\\nan ever present one with Christians.

This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness\\nthat fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with\\nthe sense world.\\n\\nIt would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient\\npeople\\'s ideas of life after death.\\n\\n\\nMankind fell into mist and darkness, and at \"the turning point of\\ntime\" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and\\nwe are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new\\nrevelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.

I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually\\nconcrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or\\nteachings today can be received.\\n\\nI am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to\\nsimple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed\\non, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception\\nand experience?

I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal\\nirrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in\\nwhich we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a\\nsingle earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the\\nreality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in\\nterms that did not try to spell it out.\\n',\n",

It\\nis only because of God\\'s own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing. \\nYour logic comes to fruition in relativism.  \\n\\nAh, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig\\'s fame is often\\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\\n(\\'21) and Philosophical Investigation (\\'53).  Many of Witt\\'s comments and\\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt\\'s\\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt\\'s own\\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\\na threshold.\\n  vonWrights\\'s comment that Witt\\'s \"sentences have a content that often lies\\ndeep beneath the surface of language.\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the\\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\\nWitt\\'s own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \\nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\\n\\n  This is why John\\'s Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\\nhe is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn\\'t shy from this, a mysticism to\\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\\nand it is verifiable.

Individual morality is a different\\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\\nbut is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating\\nmeat may be perfectly legal.\\n\\n#\\n#>#Merely a question for the basis of morality\\n#>#\\n#>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_.\\n#>#\\n#>#1)Who is society\\n#\\n#>Depends on the society.\\n#\\n#Doesn\\'t help.  Is the point irrelevant?\\n\\nNo.  Often the answer is \"we are\".  But if society is those who make\\nthe rules, that\\'s a different question.  If society is who should\\nmake the rules, that\\'s yet another.  I don\\'t claim to have the answers, either,\\nbut I don\\'t think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things\\nabout the US system, at least in principle.\\n\\n#\\n#>#2)How do \"they\" define what is acceptable?\\n#\\n#>Depends.\\n#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).\\n\\nWell, ideally they don\\'t, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.\\n#\\n#>#3)How do we keep from a \"whatever is legal is what is \"moral\" \"position?\\n#\\n#>By adopting a default position that people\\'s moral decisions\\n#>are none of society\\'s business,\\n#\\n#So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?\\n\\nBecause sometimes that\\'s necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when\\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn\\'t.\\n\\n# and only interfering when it\\'s truly\\n#>necessary.\\n#\\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\\n\\nIMO, it isn\\'t often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \\nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it\\'s a sort of\\nliar\\'s paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\\'t object if\\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\\'t arise if\\nwe don\\'t actively wish to take way anyone\\'s freedom.\\n#\\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\\n#\\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.  How can we even define that term?\\n\\nOnly by consensus, I guess.\\n\\n#  Thus you\\n#>get a situation where \"The law often allows what honour forbids\", which I\\'ve\\n#>come to believe is as it should be.  \\n#\\n#I admit I don\\'t understand that statement.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may\\nalso be seen as immoral.   The law lets you do it, but you don\\'t let yourself\\ndo it.  Eating meat, for example.',\n",

       "  '\\nTrue.  At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos\\nthe military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from\\nthe missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially\\nafter the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It\\nseemed to me that they didn\\'t have the stomach for the reality of war,\\nthat innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It\\'s like\\nthey were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was \"nice and clean\" (smart\\nmissiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead,\\ndying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!\\n\\n\\n[ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]\\n                            ^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nI should have said here \"militarily justified\".  It seems from your\\ncomments below that you understood this as meaning \"morally justified\".\\nI apologize.\\n\\n\\nI have often wondered about this.  I\\'ve always thought that the first bomb\\nshould have been dropped on Japan\\'s island fortress of Truk.  A good,\\ninpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could\\'ve been held back\\nfor use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.\\n\\nYes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan\\nwas seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately,\\nthe military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US\\'s\\nulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made\\nwhich affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the \\ncircumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the\\nsuffering caused by those decisions.  \\n\\n[...]\\n\\n\\nActually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US\\nand allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other\\nback-water country, we probably wouldn\\'t intervene.  Not that we don\\'t\\ncare, but we can\\'t be the world\\'s policman.  Or if a coup had occured\\nin Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn\\'t have acted\\nbecause there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to\\nSaudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion\\nby a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West\\'s oil \\ninterests, caused us to take action.\\n\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nI\\'m not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the\\nwar, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep\\nKuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.\\n\\nWell, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler\\nwould lead their nation to.\\n\\n\\nThey suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much?\\nThe world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many\\ninnocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable,\\nbut that\\'s The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nProbably because we\\'re not the saviors of the world.  We can\\'t police each\\nand every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor\\nare we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or\\nsome other places.\\n\\nTell me how we could stop them and I\\'ll support it.  I, for one, do not\\nagree with the present US policy of \"sucking up to them\" as you put it.\\nI agree that it is deplorable.\\n\\n\\nAre they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale\\nwhere the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed\\nunless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue\\nis in order.)  I\\'m not an expert on California law, or even US law, but\\nit seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize\\nthe system, but let\\'s not have unfounded allegations of racial \\nprejudice thrown around.\\n\\n\\nNo, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks\\non the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.\\n\\n\\nGermans, perhaps.  \"Peers\" doesn\\'t mean \"those who do the same thing\",\\nlike having murderers judge murderers.  It means \"having people from\\nthe same station in life\", presumably because they are in a better\\nposition to understand the defendent\\'s motivation(s).\\n\\n\\nOK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your*\\nlogical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.\\n\\nThe media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing\\nliberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give\\na balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative\\nsources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)\\n\\nBTW, I never used the word \"conspiracy\".  I don\\'t accept (without *far*\\nmore evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal\\nconspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.\\n\\n\\nHardly.  I didn\\'t say that it\\'s a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people\\nif the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don\\'t live in a perfect world and\\nthere are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then\\ninnocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn\\'t say\\nit is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.\\n\\n\\nI would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain\\nand suffering.  I\\'m not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That\\nconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.\\nAnd perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let\\'s say) we now know.  That doesn\\'t\\nmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn\\'t see it as\\nbeing necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of\\nan action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed\\nnecessary enough to go ahead with it.\\n\\nBut don\\'t assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I\\ndon\\'t!  I just don\\'t condemn those who had to make a difficult\\ndecision under difficult circumstances.\\n\\n\\nYou certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist.\\nI, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.\\n\\n\\nWrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to\\nthose making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply\\nrefuse to condemn them for their decision.\\n\\nOne day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action;\\neven this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of\\nthat, and I am prepared to do so.  I don\\'t believe that you can make the\\nsame claim.\\n\\n\\nAnd BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was\\nbecause you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being \\n\"so deplorable\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing\\nwasn\\'t accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a\\ndecisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,\\nprecision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big\\nstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted\\n*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians\\n(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing\\nin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some\\ncivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than\\nany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives\\nwith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories\\nof \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\\nYes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years\\nand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But \\nwe are expected to swallow that \"hundreds of thousands\" of \\n*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with \\nthe Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  \\nWhat hogwash.  If \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilians died, \\nit was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to \\nthe Allied bombing.\\n\\nRegards,',\n",

       "  '{I sent in something on this before but I believe it got lost in the\\nweekend accident the moderator described.  This is an improved\\nversion anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}\\n\\nThe standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents \\nis probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, \"Hermeneutrik und \\nKritik,\" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of\\n_Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen:\\nBeck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The \\nProphetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989).\\n(If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley\\ndescribes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little\\nknowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject\\nand the reader.)  Nibley\\'s extract from Blass\\'s work is in the form\\nof \"rules for forgers.\"  It makes interesting reading.\\n\\nI confess that I have not read Blass\\'s work, only Nibley\\'s extract\\nthereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and\\nas far as I know there is no English translation available.  However,\\nI believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that \\nany competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient\\ndocument and at least determine if it is consistent with what one \\nwould expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not \\nbe able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to \\ndetermine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and \\nculture or is a later forgery.\\n\\nActually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:\\n\\n1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example\\nthe Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific\\nmeans to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found\\nwith them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual\\nphysical objects.\\n\\n2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the\\ncopy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a\\ndocument which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something\\nfrom centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several\\ngenerations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still \\nbe tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot\\nexpect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so\\nwe must confine our testing to the text itself.\\n\\nIt is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if\\nthe document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the\\ndocument and identify its culture of origin.  For example I\\'ve heard\\nof a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king\\nin what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up\\nscholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the\\nholograph).  They could check the language, content and writing\\nstyle to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a\\nPalestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were\\npositive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually\\nwrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but\\n(barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for \\ncomparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to\\ndetermine who the actual author was.\\n\\nAs I say, I\\'m no expert on Blas\\'s work.  I do remember some of the\\ntests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.  \\nSpecifically we might ask:\\n\\n1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict\\nitself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to \\nmaintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The \\nlonger the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency.\\nFor this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.\\n\\n2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time?\\nAgain a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the\\nwriting is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be\\nable to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous\\nthings which someone from that culture would get right without even\\nthinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous \\nand trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.\\n\\n3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech\\netc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that \\nseem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?  \\nIf so do they fit in with the culture?\\n\\nOf course there are complications if the document has been\\ntranslated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language\\nwhen he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture\\nclaimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and\\nreduce certainty to be sure but don\\'t necessarily prove forgery.\\n\\nThese tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work \\nwith) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the \\nhistorian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to \\nask are, \"Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we \\nknow about the culture of claimed origin?\"  If there are things \\nwhich don\\'t fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to\\nour lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really \\nsignificant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never\\nknow everything about the culture.',\n",

Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of\\nresurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what\\nthe point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work \\n_Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ\\nCambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul\\nhere has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there\\nis no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared,\\nno ascension either.\\n\\nResurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the\\ngrave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts\\nuntil well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up\\nwith a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly,\\nI think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts\\nbefore this which mention the tomb). \\n    \\n\\n\\nYou are quite right here.

       "  'Dean Velasco quoted a letter from James M Stowell, president of\\nMoody Bible Institute:\\n\\n\\n\\nThere has been a lot of discussion, but so far nobody seems to have hit on\\nexactly what the criticism of \"arrogance\" is aimed at.\\n\\nThe arrogance being attacked is that we \"think we are the only ones who know\\nwhat the absolutes are\".  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are\\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\\n\\nIn particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can\\nthink of epistemology as \"how do you know?\"  That question, it turns out, is\\na very troubling one.\\n\\nThe problem with `absolute certainty\\' is that, at the bottom, at least some of\\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that\\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\\n\\nAnd that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of\\nauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional\\nInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of\\nPapal Infallibility, too.)\\n\\nZeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and\\nseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and\\npossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute\\nTruth.\\n\\nHe may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.\\nHis conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made\\nmistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His\\nconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made\\nmistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made\\nmistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)\\n\\nEverything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that\\nhappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what\\nhe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own\\ninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own\\nreasoning, that belief cannot be considered \"absolutely certain\".\\n\\nZeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief\\nis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can\\nsay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.\\n\\nAny belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on\\nyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible\\nthinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.\\n\\n\\nThis is easy to demonstrate.  Let\\'s go back to our shorthand method of doing\\nepistemology: \"how do you know?\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:\\n\\n A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.\\n\\n B: How do you know?\\n\\n A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church\\n    teachings and came to this conclusion.\\n\\n B: How do you know you studied history correctly?\\n\\n A: Well, I double-checked everything.\\n\\n B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?\\n\\n A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.\\n\\n B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn\\'t mean it is\\n    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?\\n\\n A: ...\\n\\nAnd, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \"I\\ncan\\'t prove that there are no mistakes\" -- and as long as you may have made a\\nmistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.\\n\\nThere is no way out of the loop.\\n\\n\\nThis is where the \"arrogance of Christians\" arises: many people believe\\nthat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the\\ndoctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are\\ninfallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.\\n\\nClaiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led\\nyou to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.\\n\\n *\\n\\nPeople who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to\\nfind _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking\\nthe idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),\\nbut the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is\\nknowably Inerrant.\\n',\n",

Why anything exists?\\n= \\n= and\\n= \\n= 2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\\n= \\n= It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question.

The second question is unanswerable indeed, for\\nhow do we identify something as \"nothing\" (aren\\'t they mutually exclusive\\nterms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this is\\nnearing the limits of this simple layman\\'s ability to comprehend, and I\\nwould appreciate an explanation). \\n\\nI might add, the worldview of \"Things that exist do, and things that\\ndon\\'t...don\\'t\" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable,\\nas does the theist\\'s belief in God.

Its very\\nfoundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a\\nreason.\\n\\nWe come to this. Either \"I am, therefore I am.\", or \"I am for a reason.\"\\nIf the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are\\nsatisfied, and need not a doctor.  If the latter, your search is just\\nbeginning.  \\n\\n= I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\\n\\nTime will tell. 8^)\\n\\n= \\n= Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\\n= Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\\n= answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\\n= actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\\n= them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\\n\\nAgreed.  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as\\nwell.\\n\\n= Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\\n= This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\\n= Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\\n= it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\\n= existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\\n\\nThis does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His\\n*qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).\\n\\n= The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\\n= of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\\n= accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\\n\\nLike the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes \\nthat the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against \\nscientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in\\nwhich we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  I\\nseek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the\\nCreator.\\n\\nI also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer \"why\".   It\\nappears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is\\ninadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting\\nthat \\'why\\' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.  \\n\\n= : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn\\'t\\n= : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\\n= \\n= This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\\n= not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\\n= questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\\n= supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\\n= as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\\n\\nMy apologies.  I was using why as \"why did this come to be\".  Why did\\npre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.\\n\\nBut we come to the admission that science fails to answer \"Why?\".  Because\\nit can\\'t be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the\\nquestion invalid?\\n= : I don\\'t believe *any*\\n= : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\\n= : having all of the parts available.

However, it is not the penultimate\\n\\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\\n\\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\\n\\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\\n\\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\\n\\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\\n\\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\\n\\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\\n\\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\\n\\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\\n\\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\\n\\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\\n\\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\\n\\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\\n\\tconversion).\\n\\n\\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\\n\\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\\n\\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\\n\\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\\n\\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\\n\\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\\n\\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\\n\\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\\n\\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\\n\\n\\n\\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\\n\\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\\n\\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\\n\\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\\n\\ta more expansive view.\\n\\n\\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\\n\\tarts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language\\n\\tof other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?\\n\\tHow is it that humans can organize themselves in various social\\n\\tstructures whereas other animals have only one structure?)\\n\\n\\n\\tBlatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.\\n\\tChristianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not\\n\\ta *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship\\n\\twith a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-\\n\\tknit relationship with this appelation.\\n\\n\\n\\tThere are \"Jesus freaks\" who let the emotional aspects of worship\\n\\tand Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,\\n\\tthis does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these\\n\\tthings flow.\\n\\n\\n\\tGuilty by association?  That \"christianity\" which forces itself\\n\\tupon another is not Christianity at all.\\n\\n\\n\\tYou appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened\\n\\t2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?\\n\\n\\tI cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus\\' influence was a sole\\n\\tresult of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years\\n\\tgone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert\\n\\tthat nothing about Jesus\\' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.\\n\\n\\n\\tChristianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.\\n\\tWhat do you know of Him?\\n',\n",

       "  'I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or\\nTrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted\\nby a 3D scanline renderer. \\n\\nI have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but\\nhave never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\\n\\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy fonts).\\n\\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\\n\\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\\n\\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\\n\\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these\\nsubjects but I can\\'t tell which method is the best to implement.\\n\\nThanks for any pointers.\\n\\n--> Rob Lansdale\\n',\n",

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew\\'s main\\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\\nwill take particular claims at face value.\\n\\nImmanuel:\\n\\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\\n\\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\\n       Joseph, will name him \\'Jesus\\' (which means G\\'d is\\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\\n       spoken by a prophet:\\n\\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\\n       lord G\\'d said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \\n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G\\'d your lord.  It\\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\\n       Ahaz said, \"I won\\'t ask; I will not put the lord to a\\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G\\'d is with us.\"   He will\\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\\n       you dread will have been deserted...\\n\\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \\nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\\nlater Christians to be G\\'d walking among men, was never called by\\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\\n\\nEgypt:\\n\\n       After Jesus\\'s birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\\n\\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\\n\\n\\nWhat the lord really said was this.\\n\\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \\n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba\\'als, and kept burning\\n       incense to idols.\\n\\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea\\'s oracle.  But, it\\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G\\'d.   Again, this prophecy\\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\\n\\nRachel Weeps:\\n\\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\\n\\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\\n       no more.\"   \\n\\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \\nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus\\'s life to enhance\\nthe message of the church\\'s gospel.\\n       Because of the whole story\\'s similarity to the tale of the\\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G\\'d\\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\\nwould not suit Matthew\\'s purpose, as the children he speaks of are\\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\\nconvincing.\\n\\nThe Nazarene:\\n\\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \\n\\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\\n\\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \\nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson\\'s mother that\\nshe will,\\n\\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\\n\\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G\\'d. \\nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\\nsimple making them up now.\\n\\nBearing our\\nDiseases:\\n\\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\\nand disabilities.\\n\\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\\n       diseases.\"\\n\\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\\n\\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\\n\\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\\nof Israel, Jehovah\\'s chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\\ninstrument of the nations\\' salvation by G\\'d.\\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew\\'s parallel\\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\\n\\n\\nSilent Messiah:\\n\\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn\\'t arouse\\nthe attention of the local rulers.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \\n\\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\\n       name.\"\\n\\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\\n\\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\\n       await his law.\\n\\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\\nG\\'d there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\\nbe the children of G\\'d.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew\\'s attempt at\\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\\n\\nThree Days and\\nThree Nights:\\n\\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\\nresurrection.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\\n       three nights.\\n\\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \\n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn\\'t forget that\\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\\n\\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew\\'s little\\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\\ngod\\'s mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\\n\\nHearing &\\nUnderstanding:\\n\\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\\n\\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \\n\\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\\n       people\\'s heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\\n       them.\"\\n\\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \\nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G\\'d,\\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\\n\\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G\\'d said, \"Go, and say to this\\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\\n       see, but do not perceive.\\'   Make the heart of this\\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G\\'ds take men far\\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\\n       stump.\\n\\nHere we see that it is really G\\'d who causes the people of Israel\\nto stop listening to the prophet\\'s warnings, but reaffirms the\\npromise made to Solomon\\'s (and David\\'s) seed/lineage.  If you read\\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\\nof G\\'d to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\\nof Isaiah\\'s verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn\\'t\\nunderstand Jesus\\'s stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah\\'s verses are\\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G\\'d to him, in the\\npresent.   Once again, Matthew\\'s prophecy falls flat on its face. \\n\\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus\\'s parables look like they\\nhave the prophetic approval.\\n\\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\\n       foundation of the world.\"\\n\\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \\n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\\n       lord...\\n\\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\\nof Matthew\\'s gospel even inserted Isaiah\\'s name as this prophet. \\nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\\nof it up.\\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \\nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \\nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\\nMatthew\\'s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew\\'s prophecies aren\\'t the\\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\\n\\n\\nExcuses of\\nLittle Faith:\\n\\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\\nthey didn\\'t have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\\nwoman\\'s arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\\n\\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \\n\\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don\\'t get to see\\nGod anymore.\\n\\n       We\\'re too lazy; we\\'re not zealous enough; we\\'re\\n       sinful; it\\'s just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\\n       own demands on G\\'d\\'s appearance; if we had the right\\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G\\'d on his terms...\\n\\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G\\'d.  You, dear\\nreader, have not seen G\\'d.  Not literally, you know that to be\\ntrue. (I know that\\'s presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we\\'ve seen religions do is\\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G\\'d.  They say\\nour little faith does not merit us to see G\\'d.  Sometimes, they\\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\\nlives of people change... that is seeing G\\'d.\"   Thus people get\\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G\\'d into the everyday\\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G\\'d as I am speaking of... it is\\nnot seeing G\\'d the way people used to see.  \\n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\\nhas little faith.\\n\\x0c\\nJesus Rides on\\nan Ass:\\n\\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\\nJerusalem.  \\n\\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\\n       by the prophet, saying,\\n\\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\\n       ass-colt.\"\\n\\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\\ndifferently.\\n\\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew\\'s version, we get a\\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\\n\\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\\n\\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven\\'t you read?  `Out of the mouth of\\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.\\'\\n\\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\\nfit Matthew\\'s track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\\nMatthew, \"Haven\\'t you read?\" for the source reads,\\n\\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\\n       enemy and the avenger.\\n\\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G\\'d,\\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\\njust one more case of Matthew\\'s pen making up convenient prophetic\\nscripture.\\n\\nYHVH said to \\nmy lord...:\\n\\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\\n\\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\\n\\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\\nnature of the messiah-king.  It\\'s tempting to believe this, if one\\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \\nBut, there are problems.\\n       In Jesus\\'s time, the psalm was thought to be about the\\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David\\'s\\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus\\'s time had\\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\\nhis audience, who thought the messiah\\'s advent was imminent, and\\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\\n\\n       YHVH\\'s utterance to my lord:\\n\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\\n       footstool.\"\\n\\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\\n       holy mountains.  \\n\\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\\n       forever.\"\\n\\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G\\'d.  It is merely an\\naddress of respect.  \\n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\\npoet, about David\\'s covenant and endorsement from G\\'d.  If the\\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\\nfrom David, was not present in David\\'s age.  We have extensive\\ntales of David\\'s doings and sayings-- none of which include any\\npraises of a messiah.\\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G\\'d had put his show of\\nfavour for David\\'s kingdom on hold.  \\n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\\npromised by G\\'d a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \\nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus\\'s question.  As we\\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\\n\\nMoses & Jesus,\\nHad it Together\\nAll Along...:\\n\\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\\npseudo-prophecy in John\\'s gospel.  The gospel story of John\\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\\nfrom the real events of Jesus\\'s career as told by even Matthew. \\nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\\nby G\\'d.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\\n\\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\\n\\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \\nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\\nwhich corresponds to John\\'s little prophecy.  It is par for the\\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\\nstill cling to it.\\n\\nThe Potter\\'s\\nField:\\n\\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn\\'t lawful for\\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter\\'s field with it to\\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\\n\\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter\\'s\\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\\n\\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\\nMatthew makes use of.\\n\\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\\n       YHVH.\\n\\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\\nof the messiah, or of G\\'d.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\\nshortly before G\\'d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\\nMatthew\\'s quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah\\'s context, whereas \"potter\\'s\\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\\nMatthew\\'s track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\\nintentional dishonesty.\\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas\\'s situation, and if\\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew\\'s work is convincing\\nenough.\\n\\nWine, Vinegar,\\n& Casting Lots:\\n\\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\\n\\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\\n\\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\\n\\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\\n\\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\\n\\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\\n       Book of the Living.\\n\\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\\npsalm asks G\\'d for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\\nJesus of the gospels says,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\\n       don\\'t know what they do!\"\\n\\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus\\'s drink, not his\\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\\n\\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\\nsay that the fact that Jesus\\'s clothes were divided as told is no\\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\\nJesus\\'s clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\\nsuspicions.\\n\\nThe 22nd Psalm:\\n\\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\\nwill examine the primary passages.\\n\\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \\n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\\n       don\\'t answer, and by night, but find no rest.\\n\\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \\nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn\\'t do much\\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\\nboth day and night on the cross.\\n\\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \\n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\\n\\nThis seems to fit Jesus\\'s execution pretty well, with the\\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\\n\\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\\n\\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\\n\\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\\n\\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I\\'m sure the early Christian\\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\\n\\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\\n       hands and feet...\\n\\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka\\'ari),\\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka\\'aru.\"   But, to\\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\\ntranslators.\\n\\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\\npsalm\\'s true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\\nthe forearms.  This doesn\\'t say much in favour of the traditional\\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren\\'t bound by our religious beliefs.\\n\\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\\ninterpretations of Jesus\\'s life and death.  How much these\\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\\nthings for St. Matthew.\\n\\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus\\'s\\ncrucifixion.  John\\'s gospel recount, written about 70 years after\\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus\\'s execution,\\n\\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\\n       \"The will look on him whom they\\'ve pierced.\"\\n\\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\\nthem.\\n\\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\\n\\nJohn\\'s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\\nMatthew\\'s attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\\nthan just one passage.  John\\'s errors are grossly obvious and\\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\\nreligion were founded.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nReckoned with\\nTransgressors:\\n\\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\\n\\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\\n\\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\\n\\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\\n\\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\\n       with him railed, \"Aren\\'t you the messiah?! Save\\n       yourself, and us!\"\\n\\nThis certainly fits with Mark\\'s recount, which tells how the\\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\\n\\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\\n       \"Don\\'t you fear G\\'d, since you are under the same\\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \\n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \\n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\\n\\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\\napparently noble and of principle, doesn\\'t seem likely to have\\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\\nLuke.  Of course, Luke\\'s recount also disagrees with Mark\\'s.  \\nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\\nwords of G\\'d do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\\nseen.\\n\\nThe End of the\\nWorld--\\n       Mt. 24:\\n\\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\\nwhich he has been warning about.\\n\\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple\\'s\\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\\n\\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \\n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\\n       the mountains.\\n\\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\\n       pass away until all these things take place...\\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\\n       at an hour you do not expect.\\n\\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\\nthem that although he doesn\\'t know the exact day or hour, that it\\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \\nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\\nswept away.\\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \\nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\\nhe didn\\'t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \\nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\\nat the Apostles\\' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\\n\\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \\nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\\njust the right moment to spring?\\n\\n\\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn\\'t in the best\\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \\nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \\nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\\nChristianity can securely keep hold.',\n",

There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence\\nof gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most\\nphilosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that\\nmust be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical\\nbasis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?\\n \\nThere is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence\\nof any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses\\nword \"on faith\", we just mean that having found this person to be\\nreliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.\\nIf we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence\\neverywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about\\ngods?\\n \\nThe difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then\\none of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,\\nrather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith\\nis in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable\\nbasis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at\\nother times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist\\nbelieves that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable\\nknowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than\\ntheism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other\\nknowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than\\nSanta Claus or the Easter Bunny?\\n \\nI would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn\\'t\\nrequire absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.

You are probably thinking of Church of God in\\nChrist, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.\\n\\n\\t2)  I\\'m not sure what you mean by \"signifying believers\"  but it\\nshould be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it\\never, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian. \\nThe doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is\\nthat speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming\\na Christian in which one is \"Baptized in the Holy Spirit\"  That may be\\nwhat you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are\\nfrequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order\\nto be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the\\nmajority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in\\nMark 16 about \"these signs following them that believe\" but they generally\\ndo not interpret this as meaning if you don\\'t pactice the signs you aren\\'t\\n\"saved\".\\n\\n\\t3)  I know it\\'s hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that\\nhas such diversity, but I think you\\'ve made some pretty big\\ngeneralizations here.  Do \"Neo-Pentecostals\" only believe in tongues as a\\nsign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message? \\nI\\'ve never heard of that before.

       "  'A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView.\\nSince he isn\\'t in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post\\nit for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:\\n\\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\\ndoesn\\'t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \\nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\\n\\n The result of this process is the following:\\n  \\n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\\'t performed.\\n\\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\\n        there was room on the disk.\\n\\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\\'s (1200x900 and bigger) can be\\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\\n\\n\\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\\ntable? I can\\'t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\\nsort a directory listing?\\n',\n",

Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task.
